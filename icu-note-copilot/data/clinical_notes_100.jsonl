This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, what brings you to the Outpatient department today?\nPatient: Good morning doctor, I have some discomfort in my neck and lower back, and I'm not able to maintain an erect posture.\nDoctor: Hmm, okay.

However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department ().

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work.

She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.\nHer condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden.

Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having a normal life and thought that his days were counted in this life. Also, a persistent refusal of any medical advice or explanation for his symptoms and fears was neither related to schizophrenia nor related to mood disorders.\\nA diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder was made despite the patient's strong refusal. The family and social history evaluation also revealed a very low socioeconomic status and similar conditions in the family. Interestingly, two of the patient's daughters had similar reported conditions which could raise the suspicion of the possible genetic predisposition that could be triggered by shared environmental factors between him and his daughters. Following this extensive detailed history and evaluation, the treating psychiatrist contacted the department of medical eligibility to make the patient's file eligible again as promised by them with an unlimited eligibility to all specialties and primary care center. For the past twenty-five years of continuous hospital visiting, he has had almost weekly and even daily visits to the primary care. The patient kept complaining of variable symptoms every week and specifically asking for certain lab tests and radiological studies. Also, he successfully convinced some physicians to order a biopsy for him.\\nIt is reported that physicians in the primary health care center used different techniques of counseling and they applied the biopsychosocial model to overcome the patient's fears but often failed to reach an achievement as the patient continued to complain of different symptoms and became a burden on the physician's clinic time and the hospital resources. It is also reported that the patient was extremely difficult to handle and convince. In the absence of institution guidelines to deal with such cases, all physicians tended to yield to the patient's persistent complaints and accepted his demands and fulfilled his desires by requesting whatever investigations the patient asked for. Over the years, the patient's investigations have cost approximately $178200 due to the system negligence to such cases. The patient's most requested investigations were mainly invasive radiological studies specifically abdomen and pelvis CT (18 times) and wide range of other invasive and noninvasive studies like chest CT (11 times), brain CT (7 times), chest MRI (4 times), lumbar spine MRI (6 times), and other studies. It is important here to put emphasis on the potential harms of radiation from radiological studies that are frequently requested by the patient in the absence of clear guidelines to be followed by practitioners for that group of patients. In addition, the patient asked for a variety of lab tests including renal profile, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, coronary risk profile, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, thyroid stimulating hormone, prostate specific antigen, free T4 level, and other very wide range of lab tests. Moreover, the patient underwent several biopsies like renal biopsy, prostate biopsy, gastric biopsy, and other different types of biopsies.\\nThe patient was abusing the system in which resources and time were wasted. The patient kept overstepping each barrier by the hospital's staff to minimize his burden on the hospital by manipulating staff and deceiving and misleading them by giving incorrect information. Also, he was targeting junior practitioners and disturbing them and even threatened to sue the administration if restricted from health care. Five years ago, an experienced board-certified family physician was shocked when he looked at the patient's file and decided to put an effort to solve this problem by taking some actions. First action considered, after getting the approval from the family medicine department, was to limit the patient's primary care visits to only one clinic and to refer him to the supervising physician himself. Then, building strong and effective patient rapport based on trust and honesty was initiated. After negotiations, the patient agreed to enroll in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for six sessions ninety minutes each. The patient was advised to have a scheduled sleeping time, ensure healthy eating habits with regular physical exercise, be involved in social activities, stay away from stressors like searching web for symptoms, and avoid TV health shows and health magazines during active cycles of disorder. After that, there was an agreement with the patient not to disturb the clinic and he would get to see the physician regularly for checkups every three months.\\nAfter five years of implementing the new rules, the patient is still visiting the clinic for regular follow-up and sometimes he breaks the rules and comes regularly to the clinic especially in active cycles of the disorder. On following the patient's condition in the last five years, it is noticed that there is a dramatic decrease in the total financial cost due to the relative decreasing number of visits, less time spent on arguing with the patient, and the filtration of his requests. Moreover, there is a remarkable improvement in the patient's condition because of CBT and relative compliance to health advice. We think that this rare case of extremely persisting illness anxiety is worth reporting because the patient managed somehow to escape attention and made a huge financial burden on hospital resources in the absence of clear guidelines in such conditions. Also, this case provides useful insight for future guidelines development.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, sir. How can I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the CT findings demonstrating turbulent flow in the ascending aorta suggestive of an intimal tear in the region although the lesion itself was not seen. The arch was mildly dilated but with no visible flap. Flow in the descending aorta was turbulent in the initial 2–3 cm suggesting intimal disruption.\\nHe underwent operative repair of the thoracic dissection on the next available theatre list.

The ablation was performed starting from the inferior lip of coronary sinus and gradually moving anteriorly towards the upper limb of coronary sinus. Intracardiac bipolar electrogram did not show any slow pathway potential near the coronary sinus ostium and at the site of successful ablation (). Just at the upper limb of coronary sinus good junctional rhythm was noted (). A complete lesion at 25-30 watts, temperature of 50ºC for 60 seconds was given. No VA or AV block was observed. Post ablation testing revealed absence of dual physiology and noninducable AVNRT. The patient was discharged on next day and till last follow up after 6 months she was asymptomatic.", "conversation": "Doctor: Hello, how are you today?\nPatient: I'm fine, thank you.\nDoctor: Can you tell me why you came to see me today?\nPatient: Yes, I have been experiencing recurrent palpitations for the last 10 years.\nDoctor: I see.

Can you tell me what happened during the physical examination?\nPatient: The general physical and cardiovascular examination were normal.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the result of the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)?\nPatient: The ECG showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval.\nDoctor: And what was the result of the electrocardiogram during the tachycardia?\nPatient: The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the result of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)?\nPatient: The TTE did not show any evidence of structural heart disease.\nDoctor: Okay. And what was the plan for the electrophysiological study?\nPatient: The electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened during the catheter manipulation?\nPatient: The catheter manipulation led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle, and I required temporary right ventricular pacing.\nDoctor: I see. And was there any tachycardia induced during the complete heart block?\nPatient: No, there was no tachycardia induced during the complete heart block.\nDoctor: And was there any evidence of accessory pathway?\nPatient: No, there was no evidence of accessory pathway.\nDoctor: I see. And how long did the complete heart block persist?\nPatient: The complete heart block persisted for 3 hours.\nDoctor: I see. And after that, were you discharged from the hospital?\nPatient: Yes, I was discharged from the hospital after 48 hours.\nDoctor: And what happened after that?\nPatient: After that, I had 3 episodes of tachycardia in 15 days, all terminated with intravenous adenosine.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the plan for the restudy?\nPatient: The restudy was planned with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened during the restudy?\nPatient: During the restudy, a catheter was put into the right internal jugular vein, and angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus, which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the risk of ablation discussed with the family and the patient?\nPatient: The risk of ablation was discussed with the family and the patient, explaining them the risk of development of complete heart block.", "summary_json": "{\n\"visit motivation\": \"History of recurrent palpitations for last 10 years\",\n\"admission\": [\n{\n\"reason\": \"Episodes of palpitations requiring hospitalization\",\n\"date\": \"None\",\n\"duration\": \"48 hours\",\n\"care center details\": \"None\"\n}\n],\n\"patient information\": {\n\"age\": \"49 years old\",\n\"sex\": \"Female\",\n\"ethnicity\": \"None\",\n\"weight\": \"None\",\n\"height\": \"None\",\n\"family medical history\": \"None\",\n\"recent travels\": \"None\",\n\"socio economic context\": \"None\",\n\"occupation\": \"None\"\n},\n\"patient medical history\": {\n\"physiological context\": \"Nondiabetic and nonhypertensive\",\n\"psychological context\": \"None\",\n\"vaccination history\": \"None\",\n\"allergies\": \"None\",\n\"exercise frequency\": \"None\",\n\"nutrition\": \"None\",\n\"sexual history\": \"None\",\n\"alcohol consumption\": \"None\",\n\"drug usage\": \"None\",\n\"smoking status\": \"None\"\n},\n\"surgeries\": [\n{\n\"reason\": \"None\",\n\"Type\": \"None\",\n\"time\": \"None\",\n\"outcome\": \"None\",\n\"details\": \"None\"\n}\n],\n\"symptoms\": [\n{\n\"name of symptom\": \"Palpitations\",\n\"intensity of symptom\": \"None\",\n\"location\": \"None\",\n\"time\": \"Last 10 years\",\n\"temporalisation\": \"5 episodes in the last year\",\n\"behaviours affecting the symptom\": \"None\",\n\"details\": \"Tachycardia with heart rate of 210 beats/min\"\n}\n],\n\"medical examinations\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"General physical and cardiovascular examination\",\n\"result\": \"Normal\",\n\"details\": \"None\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)\",\n\"result\": \"Left bundle branch block with normal PR interval\",\n\"details\": \"None\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Electrocardiogram of tachycardia\",\n\"result\": \"Similar morphology to baseline ECG\",\n\"details\": \"Heart rate of 210 beats/min\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)\",\n\"result\": \"No evidence of structural heart disease\",\n\"details\": \"Missed hugely dilated coronary sinus\"\n}\n],\n\"diagnosis tests\": [\n{\n\"test\": \"Electrophysiological study\",\n\"severity\": \"None\",\n\"result\": \"Complete heart block due to trauma to right bundle\",\n\"condition\": \"AVNRT\",\n\"time\": \"None\",\n\"details\": \"Required temporary right ventricular pacing\"\n}\n],\n\"treatments\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"Intravenous adenosine and verapamil\",\n\"related condition\": \"Tachycardia\",\n\"dosage\": \"None\",\n\"time\": \"None\",\n\"frequency\": \"As needed for episodes of tachycardia\",\n\"duration\": \"None\",\n\"reason for taking\": \"To terminate tachycardia\",\n\"reaction to treatment\": \"Tachycardia was repeatedly terminated\",\n\"details\": \"None\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Temporary right ventricular pacing\",\n\"related condition\": \"Complete heart block\",\n\"dosage\": \"None\",\n\"time\": \"During complete heart block\",\n\"frequency\": \"None\",\n\"duration\": \"3 hours\",\n\"reason for taking\": \"Due to trauma to right bundle\",\n\"reaction to treatment\": \"None\",\n\"details\": \"None\"\n}\n],\n\"discharge\": {\n\"reason\": \"Stable condition after temporary pacing\",\n\"referral\": \"None\",\n\"follow up\": \"Plan to restudy on recurrence\",\n\"discharge summary\": \"Discharged after 48 hours with a plan to restudy on recurrence\"\n}\n}"}

He had initially developed sudden weakness and difficulty using his right upper extremity at the age of 16 years. He eventually had to learn to write using his left hand because of the severity of his weakness. His symptoms progressed over several years, eventually developing into severe symmetrical upper extremity weakness and atrophy in his distal muscles. His lower extremities were spared. Our patient stated he was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy in the US when he was 25 years old. After receiving this diagnosis, he subsequently had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that reportedly confirmed his diagnosis. He had no family members with muscular dystrophy or any other neuromuscular conditions. His symptoms reached their plateau at this time. Because of the stability of his symptoms and his understanding of the disease course, our patient did not seek any further medical care for over 20 years. Upon returning to the US, he was seen by a primary care physician and referred for neurological examination to establish care as well as evaluate the worsening of previously stable chronic symptoms.\nOn presentation, our patient reported a few months of clinical deterioration, particularly recent left upper arm intermittent mild pressure pain. Our patient grew concerned when he noticed increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with his left hand. In addition, he was experiencing recurrent intermittent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods. Our patient denied ever having any previous bulbar symptoms prior to his recent clinical deterioration.\nA clinical examination demonstrated that our patient was thin with significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and associated weakness.

He had initially developed sudden weakness and difficulty using his right upper extremity at the age of 16 years. He eventually had to learn to write using his left hand because of the severity of his weakness. His symptoms progressed over several years, eventually developing into severe symmetrical upper extremity weakness and atrophy in his distal muscles. His lower extremities were spared. Our patient stated he was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy in the US when he was 25 years old. After receiving this diagnosis, he subsequently had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that reportedly confirmed his diagnosis. He had no family members with muscular dystrophy or any other neuromuscular conditions. His symptoms reached their plateau at this time. Because of the stability of his symptoms and his understanding of the disease course, our patient did not seek any further medical care for over 20 years. Upon returning to the US, he was seen by a primary care physician and referred for neurological examination to establish care as well as evaluate the worsening of previously stable chronic symptoms.\\nOn presentation, our patient reported a few months of clinical deterioration, particularly recent left upper arm intermittent mild pressure pain. Our patient grew concerned when he noticed increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with his left hand. In addition, he was experiencing recurrent intermittent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods. Our patient denied ever having any previous bulbar symptoms prior to his recent clinical deterioration.\\nA clinical examination demonstrated that our patient was thin with significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and associated weakness. He had severe asymmetric focal segmental atrophy of his bilateral forearm flexor and extensor muscle groups, with preserved and prominent bilateral brachioradialis muscles (Figure ). He had corresponding severe weakness in his upper extremities as measured using the Medical Research Council Scale, with 4-/5 to 5/5 proximal strength and as low as 1/5 strength in his distal muscles. He had bilateral radial deviation during wrist extension. Although his lower extremities demonstrated normal bulk, he had mild weakness on manual muscle testing as well. Our patient had 4/5 strength in his left hip extensors and flexors as well as 4/5 strength in bilateral knee extensors. He had no face weakness, no sensory deficits, no abnormal reflexes, no muscle fasciculations, and no upper motor neuron signs on examination.\\nCompound muscle action potentials (CMAP) of his left median, ulnar and radial nerves were absent. His upper extremity sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) responses were normal except for a slightly low amplitude of his ulnar and radial nerves. His lower extremity peroneal and tibial CMAPs and sural SNAPs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) of his upper extremities demonstrated evidence of diffuse chronic neurogenic changes in C5 to T1 innervated muscles as well as evidence of active denervation in his right triceps brachii. In his left lower extremity, chronic neurogenic changes were noted in the gastrocnemius medial head. His left cervical paraspinal muscles were normal on EMG.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast of his cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord demonstrated Chiari malformation type I with associated syringohydromyelia extending from C1 (Figure ) to T11 (Figure ). The maximal anterior-posterior diameter was 4mm and maximal lateral diameter 10mm. There was cord atrophy and mild atrophy of his paraspinal musculature (Figure ). Once the syrinx was identified on MRI, our patient was referred to our neurosurgery team for evaluation. An MRI of his brain with and without contrast provided additional views of the Chiari malformation type I (Figure ).", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, sir, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor.

Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space consistent with likely prior pericarditis. Given the location of the RA lead, care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection until all other vascular structures were exposed. With uneventful dissection of the right atrium, direct visualization of the protruding passive fixation lead was obtained (Figure ). To avoid the risks associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and given the good visualization of the perforating atria lead, an off-pump technique was considered using a “lead-inverting stitch”. To achieve hemostatic control over the region of the atrial wall where the lead exited, a purse-string stitch was placed circumferentially around the lead tip using 3–0 prolene with multiple pledgets (Figure A). The externalized tip of the perforating atrial lead was then mobilized by cutting a rim of surrounding atrial tissue. This allowed the end of the lead to be dunked within the right atrial chamber while the purse-string suture was tightened for hemostasis (Figure B and C). With this “lead inverting stitch”, the lead was free within the right atrium and could now be safely extracted using transvenous laser extraction techniques.\\nWith the heart partially verticalized, the lateral wall of the left ventricle was exposed and an epicardial lead (Medtronic 4968) was placed. It was then tunnelled through the subcutaneous tissue above the rectus sheath, secured and connected to the new pacemaker. The new pacemaker was then placed in a newly created pocket, below the left costal margin. The sternotomy wound was covered with sterile surgical towels.\\nThe infected pacemaker pocket was then opened and direct visualization confirmed the presence of a small amount of murky fluid. This fluid was sent for culture. The pocket was then extensively debrided and the four transvenous pacemaker leads were prepared for complex extraction in a standard manner beginning with retraction of the distal screw to facilitate separation of the active fixation lead tip from the myocardium interface during laser extraction. A purse string suture was subsequently positioned along the pectoral muscle around each lead at its insertion site to avoid any significant bleeding when the leads are completely removed. The lumen of each lead was then probed for patency with a standard stylet to ensure that a lead-locking-stylet can be utilized and advanced deep into the lead lumen for adequate gripping during the extraction process. Appropriate sizing of each lumen and distal delivery of the locking stylets was subsequently performed. A long silk suture thread was then tied to the outside of the lead near its insertion site, extended along the length of the lead, and tied to its end to provide further support along with the lead-locking-stylet when applying traction on the lead during laser extraction. Now that the leads have been prepared, transvenous lead extraction with a #14 French laser sheath was attempted. Due to the presence of multiple biding sites, up-sizing to a #16 laser sheath was required along with the use of a less compliant outer sheath (Visi-sheath). All the leads were removed entirely, with the perforating atrial lead removed last. There was no hemodynamic compromise throughout the procedure and no mechanical complications related to the procedure. The “lead inverting stitch” retained its integrity and hemostasis was preserved throughout the transvenous lead extraction.\\nFollowing successful lead extraction, the median sternotomy and old pacemaker pocket incisions were closed in a standard fashion and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring. The total procedure time from incision to wound closure was 5 hours and 24 minutes. Post-operative course was complicated with hypoxia secondary to atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia that resolved after 5 days.

Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was found, but without tenderness at the site. We conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection. Furthermore, a blood culture was performed, and the results were negative. An oral examination was performed considering the possibility that the oral infection had spread to the aorta and become an infectious aortic aneurysm. Multiple cavities and loose teeth were noted. Although not deemed to be a source of infection, the teeth were extracted, and the patient was prescribed an antibacterial to prevent future exacerbation. To rule out other infections, further laboratory work included a complete blood count, renal function, liver function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and IgG-4, all of which were found to be within normal limits.\\nA CT scan revealed an irregular AAA with a maximum short diameter of 36 mm within the infrarenal aorta (). Furthermore, part of the abdominal aortic intima calcifications were displaced inward, suggesting aortic dissection.\\nA laparotomy was performed by midline abdominal incision. There was no thickening of the arterial wall or retroperitoneal adhesions, as found in inflammatory aneurysms; however, part of the abdominal aneurysm wall was firmly adhered to the surrounding tissue. When the aorta was cross-clamped below the renal artery and the aneurysm was cut open, a partial defect in the intima was observed at the point where CT findings had suggested an aortic dissection.

James Cancer Hospital, she was found on clinical examination to have volume loss along the entire inferior aspect of her left breast and slight downward tilting of her left nipple and areolar complex. She had three separate well-healed surgical scars along the inferior-lateral aspect of her left inframammary fold (Figure ). Underneath these scars, she had a firm palpable mass, clinically measuring 6.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 cm in size and which clinically appeared to be adherent to the underlying left chest wall structures. She had no clinically apparent adenopathy in her left axilla.\\nA mammogram showed scarring and tissue disorganization in the inferior left breast from prior multiple biopsies, but appeared unchanged since a prior mammogram done 13 months previously at an outside community hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left breast showed an intensely enhancing lesion in the inferior-lateral aspect of the left breast, measuring 5.0 × 1.7 cm in size (Figure and ). This lesion appeared to abut the underlying chest wall musculature and appeared to efface the underlying fat plane. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 5.2 × 1.6 cm mass within the inferior-lateral aspect of the left chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the left pectoralis major muscle and left serratus anterior muscle (Figure ). A core biopsy was performed to the palpable left breast mass that confirmed the diagnosis of fibromatosis.\\nThe patient was taken to the operating room at to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and underwent a left total mastectomy, with en bloc resection of the underlying musculature (inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) and en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall structures (fourth, fifth, and six ribs, intercostals muscles, and parietal pleura). The left chest wall defect (Figure ) was then closed with a 2-mm DualMesh Gore-Tex patch (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona). The remaining portions of the left pectoralis major muscle was dissected off the underlying left chest wall and its lateral most attachments to the left humerus and superior attachments to the clavicle were divided, allowing it to rotate inferiorly to completely cover the Gore-Tex patch. The left mastectomy site was then closed in the standard fashion. No attempts at cosmetic breast reconstruction with autologous tissue transfer or expander/implant placement were considered at that time. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged to home on post-operative day eight.\\nGross pathologic evaluation of the specimen, which overall measured 14.5 × 13.3 × 6.4 cm in size, revealed a 5.2 cm tumor that was grossly invading the underlying attached skeletal muscle to a depth of about 1.2 cm (Figure ). It could not be definitively determined whether the invasion of the underlying skeletal muscle involved only the superficial muscles resected (consisting of the inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) or whether skeletal muscle invasion was to the level of the underlying intercostal muscles resected. However, both grossly and microscopically, there was no evidence of invasion into the bony ribs or underlying parietal pleura. Microscopic evaluation revealed a proliferation of relatively evenly spaced plump spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and associated with mild to moderate amounts of collagen and occasional mitotic figures (Figure ) and demonstrated that the spindle cell proliferations invaded into the adjacent skeletal muscle (Figure ). All surgical margins were negative. On immunohistochemical staining, the spindle cells were negative for S-100 protein, muscle actin (HHF-35), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. On immunohistochemical staining, less than 5% of the spindle cells were positive for Mib1 (Ki-67).

Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out. The area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst. Unstable edges of the area of MACI graft were debrided but as the entrance to the subchondral cyst was small a surgical decision was made not to further expose nor debride the cavity.\\nFailing to symptomatically improve, the patient underwent a further arthrotomy with debridement of the subchondral cyst, after which it was filled with bone graft substitute cortico-cancellous crunch granules. A periosteal flap taken from the medial border of the tibia was then applied over the lesion. The patient underwent a final arthroscopy at age 25 for debridement of an unstable fibro-cartilaginous cap at the site of the past periosteal flap.\\nIn total the patient underwent seven separate operations.\\nInitial examination upon presentation showed evidence of a moderate right knee effusion. The patient had full range of motion and the knee was stable.\\nRadiological examination included both X-Ray and MRI. X-Ray confirmed early degenerative change with intercondylar notch osteophytes consistent with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II. There was noted concavity to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle consistent with the previous area of OCD (Fig. ). MRI showed marked abnormality over the weight bearing portion of the medial femoral condyle measuring 2.3 cm × 1.5 cm. The subchondral cyst had successfully been debrided and grafted and was no longer present on MRI. A thin layer of hyper-intense tissue incompletely covered the area of abnormal cortex (at site of past bone substitute grafting) (Fig. ). The area of pathology had a modified International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score of 4. In addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping indicated significantly elevated values within the thin layer overlying the osteochondral defect but also elevated values within the surrounding cartilage (Fig. ).\\nThe patient sought advice regarding further interventions that may improve both his current symptoms but also his long-term prognosis as he wished to avoid progressive degeneration and early joint arthroplasty. After careful consideration and as he now had features of early degenerative change he was assessed as suitable for inclusion in an ethics approved, registered case series on the use of adipose derived MSC therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.\\nThe patient was given written information regarding the use of MSC therapy, including relative risks of MSC therapy and also relevant treatment alternatives that could otherwise be explored. Formal written informed consent was obtained prior to commencing therapy.\\nAdipose tissue was chosen as a source of MSCs due to ease of harvest, abundance of MSCs and the observed chondrogenic potential of adipose derived MSCs. Bone marrow aspirate was considered an alternative source or MSCs but surprisingly has a relative paucity of MSCs – comprising .001–.02% of the mono-nucleated cell population in comparison to ~1–7% found within adipose tissue [–]. Many studies have indicated similar chondrogenic potential between bone marrow derived and adipose derived MSCs [].\\nThe patient underwent an abdominal liposuction harvest procedure. Using a lateral abdominal approach, the subcutaneous fat was infiltrated with an anaesthetic tumescent fluid preparation comprising of 30 mls of 2% lignocaine, 1 ml of 1:1000 adrenaline, 1 ml of 8.4% bicarbonate suspended in a normal saline solution (total 1000 ml). Using a 4 mm lipo-aspirate cannula, 60 mls of adipose tissue and tumescent fluid was successfully harvested and collected within a sterile medical grade single use Shippert Tissu-Trans Collection filter (Shippert Medical, Colorado, USA). The sample was then transferred directly from the theatre via an air lock system to a laboratory clean room facility operated by Magellan Stem Cells (Magellan Stem Cells, Melbourne, Australia).\\nAutologous MSCs were isolated and expanded from the harvested adipose tissue using previously published protocols []. The processing of the lipo-aspirate was performed within the environment of a Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Class II using strict sterile techniques.\\nStromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from the lipo-aspirate was culture purified using standard growth media containing Minimum Essential Media Eagle (MEM) supplemented with 2 mM glutamate and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (HyClone – GE Healthcare, USA). The cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The adherent cells were cultured until 80% confluency in freshly added growth media. The cultured purified cells were then harvested at passage 0 (P0). These cells were further plated to tissue culture flasks and expanded up to passage 2 (P2). The cells were harvested and analyzed for cell count and viability using a Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, USA). The harvested cells were washed three times to remove FBS and cryopreserved in cryovials using clinical grade qualified MSC cryoprotectant media and following a previously validated control rate freezing technique of 1 °C/min [, ]. The cryovials were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until use.\\nAt completion of isolation and expansion, the cells underwent independent phenotypic analysis at Monash University and were characterised by flow cytometry using Florescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Using standards established by the Internal Society of Cellular Therapy, the cells were assessed for the presence of positive surface markers CD 90, CD 73 and CD 105 and absence of hematopoetic surface markers CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD45 [] (Tables - and Fig. ). A further sample was sent for independent sterility testing for microbial growth.\\nPrior to the intra-articular injection the cryopreserved cells were retrieved from the liquid nitrogen Dewar and thawed quickly within a sterile 37 °C water bath. The thawed cells were then washed in chilled PBS to remove cryoprotectant media, centrifuged and the resultant cell pellet re-suspended in clinical grade 0.9% normal saline. The cells were again analyzed for cell count and viability post thaw using the Muse Cell Analyzer. The cells were injected within 30 min of thawing.\\nThe patient received a total of 118 million MSCs (viability 98%) suspended in 3mls of normal saline at commencement of therapy. A second injection of 50 million MSCs (viability 95%) at 6 months was also given.\\nAt both injection time points the patient’s right knee was prepped using a chlorhexidine solution and draped. 2 mls of 1% lignocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously at the site of injection. Using a supero-lateral approach to the patella, and under sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance, the MSCs suspended in 3 mls of normal saline were injected into the intra-articular space.\\nAfter the initial injection the patient was fitted with a medial compartment customised unloading knee brace to allow protected but full weight-bearing. This was achieved using an Ossur OA Unloader One brace (Ossur, Reykjavic, Iceland).\\nThe patient was given post injection instructions, which included range of motion exercises and lower limb muscle activation exercises, and encouraged to perform repetitive low impact and low load exercises against minimal resistance on a stationary bike (continuous active motion versus continuous passive motion). This protocol was developed due to previously published evidence which has indicated the benefit of controlled load on cartilage health [].\\nImportantly, recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previous clinical papers investigating the use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy – both intravascular and intra-articular applications – and including autologous, allogeneic and expanded MSC preparations has indicated that MSC therapy is safe. No adverse events including infection, death or malignancy have been recorded.\\nSaw and colleagues have documented a self-limited flare up with discomfort and swelling following intra-articular MSC therapy []. This was not considered a serious adverse event.\\nRelative risks of the liposuction harvest procedure include infection, bruising and post operative discomfort. Whilst the risk of infection is low, the patient received a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure as part of accepted routine clinical practice [].\\nProspective analysis of patient outcome to intra-articular MSC therapy included the following measures:The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). This is a validated scoring system intended for the assessment of knee injury that may result in post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis. The score consists of 5 subscales - pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life. Standardised answers to questions are given (5 Likert scale) and each question is assigned a score of 0–4. A normalized score is calculated for each subscale (100 indicates no symptoms and 0 indicates maximum symptoms) []. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC Index 3.0). This score is a validated quality of life score and quantitatively assesses the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis []. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The patient rates their knee pain intensity over the previous week on a scale of 0–10. The NPRS has been validated for use in people with knee osteoarthritis [].\\nOutcome scores were completed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post commencement of MSC therapy and recorded using the software program Clinical Intelligence (Clinical Intelligence, Melbourne, Australia).\\nStructural outcome was assessed using MRI imaging performed prior to commencement of therapy and again at 6 and 18 months post-treatment. Semi quantitative measures of the cartilage defect were obtained using a modified ICRS score []:Grade 0: normal cartilage Grade 1: focal blistering and intra-cartilaginous low-signal intensity area with an intact surface and bottom Grade 2: irregularities on the surface or bottom and loss of thickness of less than 50% Grade 3: deep ulceration with loss of thickness of more than 50% Grade 4: full-thickness cartilage wear with exposure of subchondral bone.\\nIn addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping assesses the water content of cartilage by giving a quantifiable value to the ability of free water protons to exchange energy and move through a cartilage matrix []. Observed increased water content resulting in an increased T2 relaxation time is an indication of chondral pathology. T2 mapping has been well studied and is an accepted and validated non invasive measure of cartilage quality [].\\nThe numeric pain rating score increased at 1 month from 4 to 5 reflecting an initial self-limiting flare up (see Adverse Events). Follow-up at 6 months however showed a 50% improvement in NPRS from baseline and this had further improved by 75% with a pain score of 1 at completion of follow-up at 18 months (Fig. ).\\nKnee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores consistently improved across the period of follow-up (Fig. ). At 6 months the patient’s Symptoms Score had improved by 44% and similarly his Sport and Recreational Score had improved by over 100%. These values showed continued improvement at 18 months. The measure of Quality of Life had improved at 18 months by greater than 400% above baseline.\\nReflecting the observed improvement in KOOS, the WOMAC Knee Score showed similar consistent improvement from baseline till completion of data collection. At 18 months, the Global WOMAC Score had improved by over 20% (Fig. ).\\nStructural follow-up using MRI at both 6 months and 18 months showed significant increase in tissue covering the extensive OCD of the medial femoral condyle. Observed development of a subchondral plate suggested a layering effect from subchondral bone through to the chondral surface. There was smooth integration with the surrounding native cartilage at the periphery of the OCD (Figs. and ). Using the modified ICRS scoring system as described above, ICRS grade improved from 4 to 1.\\nT2 mapping at 6 months returned elevated values at the site of regenerative cartilage, consistent with high water content and immature cartilage (Fig. ). Further analysis at 18 months, however, indicated improved T2 values suggestive of progressive maturation of the regenerative tissue (Fig. ).\\nFollowing initial MSC therapy the patient reported swelling and increased discomfort of the treated knee. The knee effusion persisted for 6 weeks. This was managed conservatively with application of ice, a compression bandage and simple analgesia. Due to this observed reaction the second injection at 6 months was reduced to 50 million MSCs (viability of 95%). The patient reported minor swelling and discomfort for 2 weeks, with no additional management required.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I have been experiencing increasing right knee pain and debility.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your history and what has happened so far?\nPatient: Sure.

But the pain recurred and I underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14.\nDoctor: Hmm, what did the arthroscopic examination show?\nPatient: The arthroscopic probing of the lesion indicated that it was stable, but I failed conservative management and underwent a repeat arthroscopy a year later.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened after that?\nPatient: The unstable lesion was removed and a chondral biopsy was taken for autologous chondrocyte transplantation. But no healing occurred at the site of the defect.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand.

The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue.\nDoctor: I see. And how have you been feeling after that?\nPatient: One year later, I was still experiencing discomfort and swelling of the knee. I underwent a further arthroscopy and it was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, but an inner area had failed to fill completely.\nDoctor: I understand. And what happened after that?\nPatient: At age 23, due to discomfort and mechanical features of instability, I underwent another arthroscopy.

The atrium was then sutured. Afterwards, with the patient now being supported by partial cardiopulmonary bypass, the right lung was inspected. A hard resistance could be palpated in the right lower lobe. Considering the uncertainty of its nature and the use of extracorporeal circulation lobectomy was not performed. A biopsy was performed instead. The pleura was closed and the operation successfully completed.\\nThe patient recovered well on the ward and was discharged 9 days after the operation with an appointment for a partial lobectomy at a different hospital. Macroscopical and histological examination of the cardiac tumour showed a tumour measuring 40 × 25 × 20 mm, grey-yellowish coloured on cross section with adequate excisional margin. It was attached to the atrial myocardium which showed signs of interstitial fibrosis. The mesenchymal tumour was capsulated and found to be of variable width and made up of unilocular uniform adipocytes with small nuclei and focal regressive changes as well as focal giant cell granulomas.

At two weeks post injury the participant reported that she felt she was functioning at 60% of her optimum. At 8 weeks post injury the participant reported that she was running 95% pain free with little loss of function.\\nAn identical testing protocol was used across the 3 experimental days (pre injury, 2 weeks post injury and 8 weeks post injury). The muscle activity of the right gluteus maximus, bilateral lower erector spinae, and right hamstring muscle groups was recorded during right prone leg extension while lying prone on a manual therapy table. The position of the leg was controlled in all planes (no hip adduction/abduction or internal/external rotation) visually by the experimenter. A rig restricting movement or a kinematic analysis system to ensure an identical movement across trials was not used as this is not similar to what occurs during practice. The control of proper form was limited to a visual assessment as this most resembles clinical practice.\\nDisposable bipolar Ag-AgCl disc surface electrodes with a diameter of one cm were adhered bilaterally over the five muscle groups with a centre to centre spacing of 1 cm. Raw EMG was amplified 5000 times. The amplifier has a CMRR of 10,000:1 (Bortec EMG, Calgary AB, Canada). Raw EMG was band pass filtered (10 and 1000 Hz) and A/D converted at 2000 Hz using a National Instruments data acquisition system.\\nThe prone leg extension exercise was performed five times during each experimental session. The task required the subject to lie prone at complete rest with no movement while the EMG from each muscle was collected for 5 seconds. The subject then extended their straight right leg approximately six inches off the table. The leg was held isometrically for 3 seconds then lowered to the table.\\nThe data from each PLE trial was processed in the same manner. The aim of the processing for this study was to determine the order and timing of muscle activation. To determine muscle timing, it is necessary to determine when a muscle is considered active or \"on\". A muscle was considered \"on\" when the level of muscle activity was greater than 10% of the peak muscle activity during the prone leg extension. This method of determining muscle onset was used in the previous study by Bullock-Saxton et al []. The order of activation can then be determined by classifying each muscle as \"on\" when its level of activity exceeds that of its predetermined threshold. Muscle activation time (milliseconds-ms) was referenced to the time of activation of the hamstring muscle. For example, positive values (ms) occurred when a muscle's onset occurred before activation of the hamstring muscle group, and negative values indicated that muscle activation occurred after the onset of the hamstring muscle. The onset of muscle activity was determined for each muscle during each repetition of the prone leg lift. Please note that the EMG activity was not normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). While MVCs are important in the collection of EMG when there is a need for determining muscle amplitude, this was not necessary in the current study because muscle timing rather than amplitude was measured. Normalization would not influence the muscle onset results.\\nThe data was processed in the following manner: The raw EMG signal was first full wave rectified, then smoothed using a moving average technique which averaged every 100 points of data with an overlap 98 points. The bias was removed from the signal to allow resting activity to be at 0. The peak muscle activity was found and each data point was divided by this peak muscle activity. In this way, muscle onset could be determined by determining the time when the myoelectric signal exceeded 10% of the maximum. The signal was visually inspected to ensure that no artefact occurred or that the results were biologically feasible.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I was part of a study a few months ago and I recently suffered an ankle sprain.\nDoctor: Oh, I see.

The bone defect was extending from midline anteriorly to proximal ramus posteriorly and the soft-tissue defect was confined to the oral cavity []. The flap was designed in a manner so that the superior thyroid vessels were to be used as donor vessels as they were away from the previous zone of irradiation and the blood flow was also good after dissecting them and dividing to look for the volume and adequacy of blood flow. After osteotomy and preliminary intra oral in setting of the skin paddle, and during the time of anastomosis, it was found that the flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after initial good flow. Routine measures such as application of warm saline, xylocaine solution and later papaverine did not improve the flow and in such a situation, the options available were\\nTo open the right neck and use vessels from that side either directly or with a vein graft To use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the same (left) side as the flow in this vessel was good To use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with left facial artery, so as to establish the vascular flow in a retrograde manner. This was because the clipped distal ends of the peroneal pedicle vessels were near to the left facial artery.\\nBefore exploring the opposite neck or harvesting a vein graft, a decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularisation of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, the arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and left facial artery (end-to-end) and the flow was checked. The arterial flow was good as evidenced by the pulsations of the donor and recipient vessels and with the venous outflow from the distal end of the peroneal venae commitantes. This was followed by venous anastomosis between the distal end of the peroneal venae commitantes and a tributary of the left internal jugular vein (end to end). The skin paddle bleeding was also good with a sterile needle prick. Thus, the vascularity was restored with retrograde flow and was well established by the time the intra oral inset was completed []. The neck was then closed and post-op period was uneventful. After 6 weeks, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed good establishment of blood flow to the neo mandible [Figures and ].", "conversation": "Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, thanks.\nDoctor: I see that you have a history of radiation treatment for squamous carcinoma.

The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward.

The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?\nPatient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.\nDoctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?\nPatient: Yes, I did. But I have been asymptomatic ever since.\nDoctor: Okay, let me examine you physically. (examines patient) I can feel a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. We need to perform a computed tomography scan to elucidate the cause of the mass.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. What does the imaging show?\nDoctor: The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. We also conducted preoperative laboratory testing which revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.\nPatient: Do I need surgical intervention?\nDoctor: Yes, you do. The hernia repair must be performed to address the issue. Are you willing to proceed with the surgery?\nPatient: Yes, I am.\nDoctor: Great. We performed a classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and we found that it was comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance.\nPatient's Family: What was the cause of the hernia?\nDoctor: The cause of the hernia is unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.\nPatient's Family: I see. What happened during the procedure?\nDoctor: The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step.\nPatient's Family: Was there any complication during the procedure?\nDoctor: No, there was no complication during the procedure. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered.\nPatient's Family: Thank you for taking care of my family member. What are the follow-up requirements?\nDoctor: You will need to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks after the surgery.

As the shunt tube was placed on the left side, we prepared the pedicle of the DIEP flap on the right side. Although we could have used the penetrating branch on the left side containing the shunt tube, we considered that using the penetrating branch on the right side that had not previously undergone surgical operation would be safer. The shunt tube, which was located on the fascia, was covered with fibrous tissue and was not directly exposed (). However, on the closure of the donor site, the shunt tube was obstructed as it was excessively bent. We, therefore, dissected the tube from the surrounding tissue and temporally withdrew it from the abdominal cavity and re-inserted it 5-cm caudal from its original position by a brain surgeon (). After surgery, the patient had a smooth recovery and we found no signs of increased intracranial pressure or complications of abdominal wall. Partial necrosis of the spared skin of the breast occurred but was successfully treated following a conservative approach.\\nSince her breast cancer was less than 1 cm in diameter and classified as clinical stage 1 (T1N0M0), adjuvant therapy after surgery was expected to be unnecessary. Thus, immediate reconstruction was performed. However, a sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive, and broad invasion of the primary tumor was observed in the pathological examination. Therefore, she received postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and there was no recurrence of the breast cancer and her reconstructed left breast showed good shape and symmetry in comparison with the right breast at one 1 year after surgery ().", "conversation": "Doctor: Hi, Mrs. X.

The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting.

Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother.

The home care staff had some distrust towards you, causing you stress. Did you feel that?\nPatient: Yes, it was difficult to communicate with them even when we talked.\nDoctor: That's understandable. After a few home care visits, we learned that you were diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Did you know about this?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed, but I didn't want to let my parents know about it.\nDoctor: I understand. It must have been difficult for you to manage the home care schedule and chores while also dealing with your disorder.\nPatient: Yes, it was difficult at times.\nDoctor: Now that we know about your diagnosis, we can work together to make sure you have the support you need.

At 3 weeks post flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy. Radiographs showed that the segmental tibia fragment was showing good union response at the proximal end; however the distal end appeared to be rounded with attempt to callus formation which is non bridging (). Abnormal mobility at the fracture site indicated a need to stabilize the fracture, however soft tissue condition precluded any form of internal fixation. At that time the fibula fracture was completely united. A decision to do a posterior bone grafting along with bridge fibula grafting was taken to provide additional stability at the non union site. Lateral approach was taken and cancellous graft taken from the same side (right) iliac crest was filled in the interosseous membrane between tibia and fibula by at the site of the fracture, just proximal and just distal to it. Two 3.5 mm cortical screws were passed from the fibula to into the tibia at the site where the graft ends proximally and distally. This was done to make a rigid strut with cancellous graft in the middle (). Patient was put in a long knee brace and advised non-weight bearing for a period of 8 weeks. At two months after bridge grafting good callus was seen bridging the fracture and the patient was given a patella tendon bearing cast and was started on partial weight bearing. Complete union was achieved at 7 months post surgery. The ankle movement was 10 degree dorsiflexion from neutral and 20 degree plantar flexion from neutral position at that time. Patient resumed her activities at 8 months post trauma while screw removal was done at 18 months post injury. The patient was last followed up at 5 years post injury. She was walking full weight bearing and was able to carry out all her activities. The medial soft tissue scar was healthy. Ankle dorsiflexion was restricted to 10° but the plantar flexion was around 50° (). There was no history of pain or discharge from the injury site. The radiograph showed the fracture outline to have a silhouetted appearance with good union on posterior and medial side with good consolidation of the entire area of the bridge graft between tibia and fibula ().", "conversation": "Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. X.

We gave a thorough wash and debrided all dead and devitalized tissue.

Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother.

The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field.

As a small size of the ASA was visualized on the left T8 segmental artery angiography (), only the right T8 segmental artery was embolized. On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. Tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord. For this procedure, we resected both T8 roots. The operation was uneventful. No significant changes were observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM) throughout the operation. Immediate postoperative neurologic examination showed no change in neurologic status compared to the preoperative state.\\nAround 8 hours after the operation, the patient suddenly became paraplegic. Neurologic examination revealed motor power grade 0 on both lower extremities. Pain sensation was lost below the level of the xiphoid process, but touch sense and proprioception were intact. Under a suspicion of operation site hematoma, follow-up MRI was taken immediately. However, we could not identify any lesions causing the patient's paraplegia. No notable events such as hypotension during intraoperative and postoperative period was identified. Therefore, medical treatments, including hydration and high dose steroid injection, were administered and the patient was put on overnight observation.\\nThe patient did not show any neurologic improvements the next morning. We discussed this situation with the neurology and radiology departments and concluded that the neurologic features were similar to ASA syndrome. Follow-up T2-weighted sagittal and axial T-spine MRI revealed a high signal change at the anterior half of the spinal cord around the T8 level which confirmed ischemia or infarction of the anterior spinal cord (). Anticoagulation with low molecular heparin and antiplatelet medication were added. Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored and kept above 70 mmHg to maintain spinal cord perfusion pressure. However, the patient's neurologic status did not recover. One week later, the remaining touch sense and proprioception of both lower extremities had also disappeared. The spinal pathology confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Throughout 6 months follow-up, the patient remained paraplegic without any neurologic improvements.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name], I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name]. How are you feeling today?\nPatient: Good morning, Dr. [Doctor's Name]. I'm feeling a bit better, thank you.\nDoctor: I understand you were referred to our clinic for sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been experiencing pain in my back for the past 5 days. It's located in the mid-thoracic area and it gets worse when I move.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And when did you first notice the weakness in both legs and sensory change?\nPatient: It started the day after I first felt the pain.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. During the neurologic examination, it was noted that you have grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia below the level of the xiphoid process. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. I can still walk with the aid of a cane, though.\nDoctor: I see. And I understand that you've been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year. Do you have any other past medical history?\nPatient: No, that's the only medication I'm taking. I don't have any other medical history.\nDoctor: Alright. We've conducted some tests, including radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging, which showed that you have a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression.\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\nDoctor: Yes. We also ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis, but all laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. And the chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the results of the tests, we've discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since you presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization, and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Yes. And after the confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis, we'll plan further systemic work ups, such as whole body positron emission tomography. But no steroid therapy will be performed during the preoperative period.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We've also performed a spinal embolization prior to the operation.

The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well.

Repair of ventral hernia by synthetic mesh application and reconstruction of the abdominal wall with flap cover was planned. Per-operatively the abdominal skin graft was separated from the peritoneum and the underlying omentum and an inlay composite mesh was applied to secure the abdominal wall []. The graft was not de epithelialised. It was carefully separated from the peritoneum over the bowels. No perforation occurred. A free tensor fascia lata flap was applied over the mesh, but the flap failed. Then after debridement two random pattern transposition skin flaps, one from the right upper and another from the left lower abdomen were transposed over the abdominal wound and donor area was skin grafted []. Patient was discharged after 17 days with advice to wear an abdominal binder. He is presently in follow-up, it has been 18 months since surgery and there is no ventral hernia and abdominal wall is flat and intact.

Can you tell me about your medical history?\nPatient: Well, about 4 months ago I was admitted to the General surgery ward for management. I had come in contact with a high tension electric wire while irrigating my field and got full thickness burn wounds on my right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any other symptoms besides the burn wounds?\nPatient: Yes, I also had a perforation of my intestine and there was prolapse of the intestinal loops through my abdominal wound.\nDoctor: Okay, that's a lot to deal with. So, you were referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days of initial management, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And when you presented to us, you were in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Alright. Do you remember what kind of management you received when you were admitted to the General surgery ward?\nPatient: No, I don't remember much.

The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well.

She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent. Initial venous access and lead implantation was attempted across the left cephalic vein but aborted due to difficulty in delivering the pacing lead into the right ventricular (RV) cavity; the venous trajectory was that of a persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) draining directly into the coronary sinus. Right cephalic venous access was subsequently obtained and to our surprise there was an anomalous venous trajectory on the right implantation side as well (Figure ); on intra-operative venography is was evident that the right brachiocephalic vein drained directly into the left persistent SVC as the patient had an absent right SVC (Figure ). Steering the right atrial (RA) pacing lead into the RA cavity was not very difficult however positioning it in the right atrial appendage required careful manipulation. Once in the RA cavity, the straight stylet of the RA pacing lead was exchanged for the curved “J” stylet and clock-wise torque was applied during further advancement of the lead to direct it anteriorly in the optimal atrial appendage position (Figure ). Positioning the RV pacing lead was a challenge since the pacing lead was gaining atrial access across the coronary sinus (CS) OS which is located very close to the RV inlet however the CS OS directs the lead away from the RV inlet towards the lateral free wall of the RA. We were able to redirect the RV pacing lead into the RV by reflecting its tip off the RA free wall thus looping the lead around into the RA and back into the RV (Figure ); in order to reflect the tip of the RV pacing lead off the RA free wall it is very important to withdraw the straight lead stylet back a few centimeters to ensure the tip of the lead is no longer stiff and thus reduce the risk of atrial perforation. Once across the tricuspid valve, the straight stylet can be advanced further if necessary to guide the pacing lead to the RV apex. Alternative methods that could be attempted to direct the RV pacing lead into the RV cavity in such complex anomalous venous anatomy includes adding significant distal curve to the lead stylet or using one of the curved long venous access sheaths that are typically used for CS OS canulation during cardiac-resynchronization therapy device implantation.\\nFollowing pacemaker implantation, the patient was monitored overnight in the cardiac telemetry unit and discharged home the following day. Her symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion resolved following device implant.\\nIn this case report, we document our pacemaker implantation technique in a patient with a very rare venous anomaly involving an absent right and persistent left superior vena cava.\\nVenous anomalies of the thorax can occur in isolation or association with congenital heart disease (CHD). A persistent left SVC (Figure ) can be identified incidentally in 0.5% of the general population and 4% of patients with CHD. Typically when present the left SVC is alongside a smaller caliber right SVC and the left SVC is usually not associated with a brachiocephalic vein. In the incidental and benign setting, the left SVC drains directly into the coronary sinus; when draining directly into the left atrium, the persistent left SVC is usually associated with CHD with the most common being atrial septal defects and coarctation of the aorta [,].\\nAnomalies of the right SVC can include drainage to the left atrium, low right atrial insertion, aneurysmal dilatation, and anomalous left brachiocephalic vein drainage to the right SVC []. Persistent left SVC with an absent right SVC is very uncommon in the general population and occurs in 0.07 to 0.13% of patients who have CHD with viscera-atrial situs solitus [].\\nLong-term prognosis in abnormal SVC development is good in the absence associated CHD []. Venous anomalies however can make central venous access and in particular pacemaker lead implantation very challenging; this includes single and dual pacemaker implantation along with cardiac resynchronization therapy whereby the insertion of any lead (atrial, ventricular, or coronary sinus leads) would be challenging due to the unfamiliar venous course which does not conform with the pre-formed shapes of the venous access tools utilized during these procedures. These venous anomalies can also cause procedural challenges in any other types of thoracic and cardiac surgeries especially if the physician is not familiar with the course of the venous anomaly at hand along with other associated congenital abnormalities. Pre-operative imaging with venography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or agitated-saline contrast echocardiography can help identify cases of challenging venous anatomy allowing appropriate operative planning; careful patient selection is warranted given the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity.\\nThe pacemaker lead implantation techniques we described above to overcome the challenges of this particular anomalous venous drainage case may not apply or be effective in all patients with similar or differing anatomy. It is therefore essential to evaluate the underlying venous anatomy at hand objectively using intra-operative venography or pre-operative imaging if possible when an anomalous anatomy is suspected. Once the anatomy is clarified, the technique that is the safest and least invasive for a particular scenario should be attempted first. Failure to implant pacing leads intravenously may warrant consideration for surgical epicardial lead implantation. In the setting of failed endocardial defibrillator lead implantation attempts, subcutaneous defibrillators can also be considered.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, how may I help you today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor.

We also did a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the visit and it showed that you have complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that your heart is not beating normally and it's using a backup system to keep beating.

In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well.

The patient's past medical records from another hospital demonstrated that his endothelial cells of both eyes presented with a normal shape and numbers under a specular microscope about six years ago. However, endothelial cells were found as indeterminate forms using specular microscopy due to the barrier of stromal opacity at the time of our study. The endothelial cells of the left eye were counted using a Konan Noncon Robo-8400 noncontact specular microscope (Konan Medical Inc., Hyogo, Japan) as 2564 cells/m2. We assumed that the right eye would have a similar amount of endothelial cells and a relatively uniform morphologic pattern as those of the left.\\nUltrasound corneal pachymetry (Humphrey Instruments Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA) revealed a central corneal thickness of 658 µm in the right eye and 632 µm in the left. The patient was suspicious for CHSD based upon clinical evidence, and he was scheduled for penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye. A corneal button was sent for light and electron microscopic analysis.

After 12 months, the corneal graft remained clear, and the patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 50 in the right eye.\\nLight microscopy with hemotoxylin and eosin staining revealed a normal epithelium and uninterrupted Bowman's membrane. The stromal lamellae were separated slightly from one another, forming a relatively compact space in between the anterior and the posterior stroma ().

Any infiltration, vessels, inflammatory, or storage material could not be detected.\\nElectron microscopy revealed a criss-crossing pattern of corneal collagen fibers with a relatively electron dense and lucent structure and collagen fibers irregular in shape and size (). Keratocytes extended widely through the zone of low filaments ().\\nBlood was sampled from the patient and family members for DNA collection and analysis []. DNA sequencing analysis of the decorin gene in chromosome 12q22 was positive in both the patient and his mother. The novel mutation of a heterozygous, nucleoside substitution (c.1036T>G) point mutation in the decorin gene was detected in both patients ().

The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily.

She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished.

Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother.

I see that you underwent a cardiac catheterization. Can you tell me about the results?\nPatient: The cardiac catheterization did not show any narrowing or disease of vessels. My ejection fraction was 65% and the previous grafts and stent were patent.\nDoctor: Great. And were you scheduled for discharge?\nPatient: Yes, I was scheduled for discharge but then I suddenly developed left-sided weakness and facial droop.\nDoctor: I see. We called the rapid response team and you underwent a CT scan with no contrast. The CT scan showed no evidence of any acute or significant intracranial abnormality and no bleeding.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And the neurology team was consulted. They recommended the use of tPA. However, we discovered that your aPTT was higher than the upper normal limit due to the recent use of unfractionated heparin for cardiac catheterization.\nPatient: Yes, I understand.\nDoctor: At this time, the primary team made the decision to recheck your aPTT after one hour since you were still within the therapeutic window for tPA. And the repeat aPTT was within the normal limit.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We will keep you in the ICU for observation and we will monitor your condition closely.

He was discharged to home on post-operative day 5 ().", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hmm, I'm feeling okay, doctor.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. I understand that you were admitted to the hospital three days ago with a transient ischemic attack and new onset atrial fibrillation.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And I also understand that you underwent an attempted pacemaker placement. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes, I was having sinus bradycardia and they wanted to put in a pacemaker.\nDoctor: I see. And after the placement of the five French sheath, what happened next?\nPatient: Well, after they placed the sheath, they noticed arterial blood return and then the procedure was aborted.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. And then you were taken to the computed tomography scanner for evaluation of arterial injury, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And the CT scan revealed direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: I see. And then you were transferred to our institution for higher level of vascular surgery care, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And when you arrived, you were intubated and sedated with the sheath in place in the left chest, covered with a dressing and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I see. And then you were taken to the hybrid operating room in our facility, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And I understand that we placed two proglide devices in the left access in standard preclose technique as this was our anticipated side of device deployment, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what I was told.\nDoctor: And then a pigtail catheter was advanced into the ascending aorta and an arch aortogram was performed, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And the aortogram demonstrated a direct cannulation of the aortic knob, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: I see. And we elected to proceed with stent graft placement to manage this injury as your comorbidities and advanced age were prohibitive risks for open repair, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: And prior to the placement of an endoprosthesis, a cerebral angiogram was performed to identify cerebrovascular dominance, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And the angiogram demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: I see. And there was adequate distance from the site of sheath insertion to the left subclavian artery, such that we felt we could achieve a seal without covering the left subclavian artery, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: I see. Based on our preoperative measurement of our anticipated proximal and distal seal zones, everything went well with the procedure, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Great, it's good to hear that.

Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Our first decision was to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap, however, the surrounding area was highly scarred, and the gastrocnemius muscle was found to be very atrophic and no suitable to fit the large defect. shows no other local flaps to be large enough to cover the whole defect, so we opted for a free flap.\\nA lack of receptor vessels was evidenced, descending genicular artery was dissected, but small caliber and calcified plaques in the lumen discarded this option. With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.", "conversation": "Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hmm, not too good, my knee wound hurts.\nDoctor: I see.

Surgical debridement and irrigation with the exchange of the modular components were performed. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started with teicoplanin, amikacin, and rifampicin according to the Infectious Diseases Department’s protocol at our institution. Amikacin was stopped 3 days after surgery because no Gram-negative Bacilli were isolated. All four samples obtained during the debridement were positive for E. faecium 5 days after surgery with identical sensitivity tests as for the first hip. Pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment was then started with amoxicillin and rifampicin. 2 weeks after debridement and 1 month after the first surgery, the patient was again readmitted due to wound drainage of the same right hip. Again, surgical debridement and exchange of modular components were performed continuing with the same antibiotic treatment. For the second debridement, one out of five samples was positive for Propionibacterium acnes. Amoxicilin treatment was followed during 3 months.

There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing. Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed and assist in brachytherapy planning [Figure ]. The margins of the resection were involved with tumor, as demonstrated by field biopsies and assessment of the margins of resection. Satellite tumor nodules were present in the resection specimen. Four days after surgery the six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125 (Figure). The dwell time of the implant was 62 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2480 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Two weeks later the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy/day and received a course of treatment and total external beam dose of 5040 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered with two beams using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in March 2000.\\nThe patient suffered moist desquamation corresponding to the radiation therapy portal that was predicted based on the treatment and the use of a tissue equivalent bolus material which was placed on the wound on alternating days during her course of external beam irradiation. She was able to return home on the last day of treatment. On routine follow-up, only 4 months after treatment, left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg by less than 1 cm. No corresponding gait problems were reported. Nearly one year after treatment (January 2000) physical examination showed good range of motion at the left knee; however, there was significant valgus angulation. An MR study was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and was noted to show growth arrest laterally and predominantly involving the distal femoral physis [Figure ]. Based on these findings, the family was informed that an epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis would likely be required to prevent additional deformity. Due to the angulatory deformity, an osteotomy of the distal femur would be required. Because of high-dose irradiation and concerns about bone healing, osteotomy and epiphysiodesis were deferred until the three year evaluation was performed. At that time, the patient had a significant valgus deformity. The morbidity of the deformity was such that ambulation was difficult. The patient underwent a closing wedge correcting osteotomy, which was fixed with a contour plate. The patient subsequently fractured the plate secondary to early and unprotected weightbearing (against medical advice). She was placed in a cast and ultimately healed her osteotomy. She continues to have a significant limb length discrepancy and will require future lengthening procedures. She remains without evidence of disease nearly 4 years after treatment.", "conversation": "Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith.

It radiated to his left shoulder and was not relieved by rest. Patient had a five pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He would occasionally drink alcohol. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes. He was not on any medications and did not use any pain relieving medicines either for his prior symptoms.\nIn the emergency room, patient was in mild distress and had a blood pressure of 165/81, something new for him. All the rest of the vital signs were normal and both the cardiac and pulmonary examination did not reveal any abnormality either. The basic laboratory work up was normal except a lipid profile showing elevated cholesterol of 238 mg/dl. The patient had an electrocardiogram that showed some premature supraventricular complexes without any ischemic changes. Cardiac biomarkers including serial troponin-I were also normal.

It did not show any obstruction in the coronary", "full_note": "A 35 year old obese African American male, a mechanic by profession and no significant previous medical problems, came to the emergency room with left sided chest pain that started the night before and slowly got worse. By the time he reached the emergency room, the pain had reached 8 out of a maximum of10 in intensity. The pain was precipitated and aggravated by a stressful situation at home. It radiated to his left shoulder and was not relieved by rest. Patient had a five pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He would occasionally drink alcohol. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes. He was not on any medications and did not use any pain relieving medicines either for his prior symptoms.\\nIn the emergency room, patient was in mild distress and had a blood pressure of 165/81, something new for him. All the rest of the vital signs were normal and both the cardiac and pulmonary examination did not reveal any abnormality either. The basic laboratory work up was normal except a lipid profile showing elevated cholesterol of 238 mg/dl. The patient had an electrocardiogram that showed some premature supraventricular complexes without any ischemic changes. Cardiac biomarkers including serial troponin-I were also normal. The chest pain subsided in the emergency room with intravenous morphine. The patient was admitted to the hospital in the telemetry unit. He was found to have some runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia while in the hospital. He underwent a cardiac exercise stress test and an echocardiogram which revealed that patient had a normal ejection fraction but a dilated left atrium along with apical wall motion abnormality.\\nPatient then underwent a cardiac catheterization. It did not show any obstruction in the coronary arteries, but did reveal a \"tumor blush\" with neovascularization seen projecting from the left circumflex artery to the \"tumor blush\". (Figure ) Following the cardiac catheterization, patient had a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for any mass or tumor. The CT scan showed a 6 cm solid and likely necrotic mass beginning slightly anterior to the carina and extending caudally posterior to the left atrium. (Figure ) No prior imaging was available for comparison.\\nAs it was still unclear whether the mass was originating intrinsic or extrinsic to the heart, so to define it better anatomically, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed. The TEE also showed the large mass, likely extrinsic to the heart, compressing the left atrium. (Figure ) Finally, the patient underwent an open heart surgery for definitive diagnosis and management. During surgical exploration, an extremely hard mass was found on the dome of the left atrium, and on further exploration, the indurated tissue clearly extended to the left atrial appendage, underneath the superior vena cava and past the origin of the right superior pulmonary vein. Frozen sections of the biopsy from the tumor were suggestive of \"Cardiac Paraganglioma\", showing tumor cells arranged in a nest-like (Zellballen) pattern-separated by thin vascular network. (Figure ) This was later confirmed further with special staining. The patient's tumor was initially deemed unresectable, because of its location and local invasion, by the operating surgeon and the median sternotomy incision was closed. However, patient then had a second opinion by a different surgeon who successfully resected the tumor and the patient recovered from the operation without any major complications. His normetanephrine levels which were very elevated before the tumor resection (1447 microgram/24 hours), normalized to 312 microgram/24 hours (normal value 110–620 microgram/24 hours) after the tumor was resected. Five years later he is doing well with no recurrence of the tumor, though he has to use a thiazide diuretic for blood pressure control.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\nPatient: Not so good, doctor. I've been having chest pain for the past few days.\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me?\nPatient: Yeah, it's a sharp pain on the left side of my chest. It started last night and got worse as the night went on.\nDoctor: Hmm, I understand. And was the pain precipitated or aggravated by anything in particular?\nPatient: Yeah, it was stress at home that made it worse.\nDoctor: I see. And did the pain radiate to any other parts of your body?\nPatient: Yeah, it went all the way to my left shoulder.\nDoctor: Okay. And was the pain relieved by rest?\nPatient: No, it wasn't.\nDoctor: Alright. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?\nPatient: Well, I used to smoke, but I quit 10 years ago.

And what did your electrocardiogram show?\nPatient: It showed some premature supraventricular complexes, but no ischemic changes.\nDoctor: I see. And what about your cardiac biomarkers, including serial troponin-I?\nPatient: They were normal.\nDoctor: Alright.

With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap.

It was composed of fascicular architecture of bland spindle or polygonal cells (Fig. ). Neither necrotic foci nor mitotic figures were observed. The tumor was immunopositive for epithelial membrane antigen (Fig. ), D2-40, progesterone receptor, vimentin, and S100 but negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Although curettage specimens from the vertebral bone were fragmented, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were identical to those of the pulmonary lesion (Fig. ). The tumor was shown to be a transitional meningioma on histological examination, including immunohistochemical analyses (Table ).", "conversation": "Doctor: Hello, how are you today?\nPatient: I'm good, thank you.\nDoctor: I see here that you came in for a regular checkup, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: During your checkup, we found a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to evaluate it further to determine what it is.\nPatient: Okay, what do I need to do?\nDoctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the biopsy samples were too small to make a definitive diagnosis. We suspect that there may be multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, so we'll need to observe you closely.\nPatient: Okay, I'll do whatever I need to do.\nDoctor: Five years later, your CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. We also found an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We'll need to perform video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion to evaluate both.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: During the surgery, the orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor is contained and hasn't spread to other areas.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: During your clinical course, we didn't find any significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, even with imaging examinations such as CT and MR imaging.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that you made good postoperative progress and have remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.\nPatient: Thank you so much for your help and for taking care of me.\nDoctor: Of course, it's our pleasure.

Due to the extent of the disease and associated abscess the anterior wall of the duodenum came away with the colon during this manoeuvre. A retrograde cholecystectomy was carried out to resect the residual tumour invading the gall bladder. The ampulla was identified with the aid of a transcystic catheter. An 82 mm expandable covered duodenal stent with a diameter of 18 mm (Hanarostent, duodenal/pyloric, M.I. Tech Co. Ltd, Seoul, N. Korea) was manually inserted through the duodenal perforation into the proximal duodenum with the distal end of the stent inserted into D2. A small opening into the side wall of the stent was made prior to the positioning of the stent to accommodate the ampulla and thus facilitate drainage of bile within the stent. A per-operative cholangiogram confirmed free flow of contrast in the duodenum. The residual duodenal wall was closed over the stent and following antrectomy a gastrojejunostomy was formed to bypass the duodenum (Bilroth II reconstruction).\\nThe patient was discharged 7 weeks later following a prolonged, but otherwise uncomplicated recovery. He subsequently underwent a palliative course of chemotherapy survived for a further 18 months without gastrointestinal symptoms, before succumbing to his disease.", "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I was admitted to the hospital 10 months ago with a history of epigastric pain, fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Sure, I had a lot of pain in my upper stomach and I was very tired all the time. I also lost 10 kgs and my skin turned yellow.\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. And what happened during the Clinical examination?\nPatient: The examination showed that I was anemic and there was a tender mass in my right upper quadrant.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any CT scan done?\nPatient: Yes, I did. The scan revealed a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass near my duodenum. It contained fluid and air and was close to my colon.\nDoctor: Okay, and what was the working diagnosis?\nPatient: The doctors said it was a collection caused by a perforation in my colon. I was treated with antibiotics and improved with conservative management.\nDoctor: I see. And after that, what happened next?\nPatient: I was discharged after a month and had a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy showed a lesion in my transverse colon and the histology showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nDoctor: Okay. And then, did you come back to the hospital again?\nPatient: Yes, I did. I had an upper gastrointestinal bleed and came back to the Accident and Emergency Department.\nDoctor: I see. And what did the repeat CT scan show?\nPatient: The scan showed localised perforation in my colon with an abscess near my duodenum, and thickening in my ascending colon around my hepatic flexure.\nDoctor: Hmm. Given the presentation and diagnostic uncertainty, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. The laparoscopy showed a large perforated tumour at my hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules.\nDoctor: I see. And then, what happened next?\nPatient: A laparotomy was performed through a transverse incision and the tumour was found to have invaded my gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity in front of the second part of my duodenum.\nDoctor: I see. And was it possible to resect the tumour and form a primary closure of the duodenum?\nPatient: No, it wasn't possible. The size of the hole was 5 cm × 2 cm and there was a lot of malignant tumour invading the duodenum.\nDoctor: I see. And what was done then?\nPatient: A right hemicolectomy was performed to remove as much of the tumour as possible and an ileotransverse anastamosis was formed.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the reason for that?\nPatient: Due to the extent of the disease and the associated abscess, the anterior wall couldn't be repaired.\nDoctor: I see. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?\nPatient: No, I think that's all, doctor. Thank you for your time.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned and referred for pathologic examination, in an attempt to determine the etiology of the rapid sequential development of the giant fusiform aneurysm.\\nFollow-up angiography, performed three days after the bypass surgery, revealed a patent bypass graft. After a test balloon occlusion at the level of the proximal basilar artery, which ensured adequate perfusion to the upper parts of the brain stem and cerebellum through the left PCoA (), coil embolization of the basilar trunk aneurysm was done. Fourteen detachable platinum coils with a total length of 155 cm were deployed in the aneurysm. Upon completion of the embolization procedure, the blood flow to the posterior circulation through the PCoA was maintained well, with near-complete occlusion of the aneurysm (). Postprocedural heparinization was not done. The patient was managed in the neurosurgical intensive care unit and recovered without further neurologic deficit. However, six hours after the end of the embolization procedure, the patient developed dyspnea, dysarthria, and quadriparesis. Intubation and ventilator care was undertaken, and heparinization was started. Enlargement of the aneurysm due to thrombus was revealed by MR imaging, and angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm. The patient became stable after two days and, one month after the intervention, independent daily activity became possible and she was discharged from hospital. Pathologic examination of the vessel specimen showed intraluminal projections of fibrous tissue with smooth muscle and capillary proliferation, but failed to reach a definite etiologic diagnosis.\\nFollow-up angiography performed three months and one year post-treatment, respectively, revealed complete and stable occlusion of the basilar trunk aneurysm and good perfusion to the entire brain. MR imaging showed marked shrinkage of the aneurysm of the basilar trunk, with no evidence of brain stem compression ().
