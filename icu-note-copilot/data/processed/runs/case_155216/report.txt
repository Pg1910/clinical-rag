SOAP SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SUBJECTIVE
- A sixteen-year-old girl presented with discomfort in the neck and lower back, alongside restriction of body movements [CN_155216_0]. She developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of starting olanzapine 5mg daily, associated with a sustained abnormal neck contraction pulling her head to the right [CN_155216_3]. She had a history of bipolar affective disorder diagnosed at age 11, previously managed with olanzapine [CF_155216_3].

## OBJECTIVE
- She was unable to maintain an erect posture and would fall to either side while standing [CN_155216_0]. The neck contraction caused a sideways bending of the lumbar region [CN_155216_0]. She had been experiencing these difficulties for four months since starting olanzapine [CN_155216_2].  She had previously been treated with trihexyphenidyl 4mg daily for upper limb rigidity [CN_155216_4]. [CS_155216_45]

## ASSESSMENT
- The patient presents with dystonia, likely related to olanzapine use [CF_155216_3, CF_155216_4]. The sustained neck contraction suggests a possible segmental dystonia or multifocal involvement [CF_155216_20]. [CS_155216_40]

## PLAN
- Olanzapine was reduced and stopped due to persistent symptoms [CF_155216_9].  Further investigation into the cause of the dystonia is warranted [Information needed: Further neurological evaluation and consideration of other medications]. [CS_155216_47]

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Dystonia (Primary Multifocal or Segmental) (high confidence)
   Supporting evidence:
   - csv_full_note: These movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced. [CF_155216_14]
   - csv_full_note: tiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg  [CF_155216_20]
   Missing: Detailed neurological examination including cranial nerve assessment, pronator drift, and assessment of other involuntary movements. MRI of the brain to rule out structural lesions.

2. Olanzapine-Induced Dystonia (Secondary) (moderate confidence)
   Supporting evidence:
   - csv_note: The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction  [CN_155216_3]
   - csv_full_note: olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for  [CF_155216_9]
   Missing: Assessment of olanzapine dose and duration of use.  Consideration of other medications that could contribute to dystonia.

3. Bipolar Disorder with Psychomotor Abnormalities (moderate confidence)
   Supporting evidence:
   - csv_full_note: A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an [CF_155216_0]
   - csv_full_note: d been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg d [CF_155216_3]
   Missing: Detailed psychiatric history, including mood charting and assessment of cognitive function.  Consideration of other mood stabilizers.
