She developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of starting olanzapine 5mg daily, associated with a sustained abnormal neck contraction pulling her head to the right [CN_155216_3]. She had a history of bipolar affective disorder diagnosed at age 11, previously managed with olanzapine [CF_155216_3].\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n- She was unable to maintain an erect posture and would fall to either side while standing [CN_155216_0]. The neck contraction caused a sideways bending of the lumbar region [CN_155216_0]. She had been experiencing these difficulties for four months since starting olanzapine [CN_155216_2].  She had previously been treated with trihexyphenidyl 4mg daily for upper limb rigidity [CN_155216_4]. [CS_155216_45]\n\n## ASSESSMENT\n- The patient presents with dystonia, likely related to olanzapine use [CF_155216_3, CF_155216_4]. The sustained neck contraction suggests a possible segmental dystonia or multifocal involvement [CF_155216_20]. [CS_155216_40]\n\n## PLAN\n- Olanzapine was reduced and stopped due to persistent symptoms [CF_155216_9].
