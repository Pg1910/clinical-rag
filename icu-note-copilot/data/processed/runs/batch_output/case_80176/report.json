He has a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed at age 18 [CN_80176_0]. He reported worsening motion through the nonunion site after three months of conservative treatment [CN_80176_2].\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n- Radiographs revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture [CN_80176_1, CF_80176_1]. A motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand [CN_80176_1].\n\n## ASSESSMENT\n- The patient presents with a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and a hypertrophic nonunion of the ulnar shaft following prior elbow arthrodesis [CN_80176_1, CF_80176_1].\n\n## PLAN\n- Conservative treatment with a cast was initially attempted for three months, but was unsuccessful [CN_80176_2, CF_80176_2]. Surgical intervention for the ulnar nonunion is being considered [CN_80176_3, CF_80176_3]. Further evaluation and discussion of surgical options are warranted [CF_80176_3].",
