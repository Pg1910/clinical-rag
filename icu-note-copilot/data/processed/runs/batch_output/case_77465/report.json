He reported being in good state and very active [CN_77465_0, CV_77465_2, CF_77465_2]. He had a previous simple fracture of the 9th right rib one year ago [CN_77465_0, CV_77465_3].\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n- A CT scan revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax measuring 8 x 4 cm with heterogeneous density [CF_77465_1].\n- Micronodular infiltrations were seen in both lungs up to 5mm in diameter, and a single nodule of almost 1cm in the lower lobe of the right lung [CF_77465_2].\n- Frozen biopsy of the lung lesions and an excision biopsy of the thoracic wall tumor were performed [CF_77465_3, CF_77465_4].\n- The biopsy results were negative for malignant cells [CF_77465_4].\n\n## ASSESSMENT\n- The patient presented with a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs [CF_77465_3].\n\n## PLAN\n- Oncologic resection of the tumor of the thoracic wall was performed [CF_77465_4]. The patient was discharged in very good condition five days after the procedure [CF_77465_6].  Information needed: Further follow-up to monitor for recurrence [Not documented].",
