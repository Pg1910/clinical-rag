  "soap_summary": "## SUBJECTIVE\n- The patient is a 47-year-old male who presented with recurrent attacks of pain in both knees over 1 year [CN_72232_0, CF_72232_0]. In September 2016, he experienced severe pain in the left knee due to trauma and increased weight-bearing [CN_72232_1, CF_72232_1].  He reported gradual pain in the right knee in April 2017 with no swelling [CN_72232_4, CF_72232_4].\n\n## OBJECTIVE\n- MRI revealed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle with complete resolution of the bone marrow edema of the medial femoral condyle [CN_72232_3, CF_72232_3].  Initially, the left knee MRI showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle [CN_72232_2, CF_72232_2]. The right knee MRI showed extensive marrow edema involving the medial femoral condyle [CN_72232_4, CF_72232_4].  The patient’s lab results showed a vitamin D level of 8 ng/mL [CF_72232_8]. [CF_72232_8]\n\n## ASSESSMENT\n- The patient’s symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with recurrent episodes of bone marrow edema, likely related to chondral changes in the knees [CN_72232_2, CN_72232_4]. [CN_72232_3]\n\n## PLAN\n- The patient was treated conservatively with NSAIDs and physiotherapy [CF_72232_2, CF_72232_3].  He was advised to use a cane to minimize weight bearing [CF_72232_3]. Further investigation with DXA scan revealed a T score of -1.0 indicating osteopenia [CF_72232_9].  Information needed: Further evaluation to assess the underlying cause of the bone marrow edema, including consideration of rheumatological workup [Not documented].",
