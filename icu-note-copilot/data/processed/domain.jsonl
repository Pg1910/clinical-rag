The clinical definition includes respiratory distress, \ntachypnea (increased respiratory rate), severe hypoxemia (low oxygen \npartial pressures in arterial blood due to improper oxygenation of blood \nin the lungs), decreased pulmonary compliance, and specific X-ray \nfindings.  The major mechanism behind these symptoms is increased \npermeability of lung capillary blood vessels, resulting in the collection of \nprotein-rich fluids in alveolar spaces (the gas exchange compartments of \nthe lung), thus limiting the surface area for gas exchange and stiffening \nthe lungs in general.  The syndrome may be triggered by a variety of \ncauses such as trauma, sepsis, aspiration, fractures, burns, certain drug \noverdoses, smoke inhalation, etc.  Although the definition of the \nsyndrome varies from site to site, all definitions refer to a group of \npatients requiring mechanical ventilation with high fractions of inspired \noxygen.  An estimated 150,000 cases occur each year in the U.S. alone \nand the mortality, despite significant advances, is over 50%.

This limit is referred to as peak inspiratory pressure (PIP).  \nFrom there on, the ventilator maintains that pressure in the airways until \nthe end of the inspiration phase.

However, the ventilator \nmaintains a preset positive pressure during expiration in order to \nprevent the alveolar spaces from collapsing.
