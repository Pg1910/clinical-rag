  "full_note": "HISTORY: 65-year-old female with history of Parkinson's disease on olanzapine, presented with chief complaint of left arm pain following a fall 3 months prior. Patient reports progressive worsening of pain, now radiating to shoulder. Associated symptoms include difficulty raising arm above head, decreased grip strength. No numbness or tingling reported.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Olanzapine 5mg daily (recently discontinued due to rigidity), Carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 TID.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Left shoulder with limited abduction (60 degrees vs 180 normal), tenderness over rotator cuff insertion. No visible deformity. Neck shows mild rigidity, improved since olanzapine discontinuation.\n\nASSESSMENT: Rotator cuff injury vs frozen shoulder, likely exacerbated by fall. Medication-induced rigidity improving.",
  
  "conversation": "Patient: I fell about 3 months ago and hurt my left arm. It's been getting worse.\nDoctor: Can you describe the pain? Where exactly does it hurt?\nPatient: It's mainly in my shoulder area, but sometimes goes down my arm. I can't lift my arm up like I used to.\nDoctor: On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the pain?\nPatient: About a 6 or 7, worse when I try to reach for things.\nDoctor: Have you had any numbness or tingling?\nPatient: No, just the pain and stiffness.\nDoctor: I see you were on olanzapine. How has your neck stiffness been since stopping it?\nPatient: Much better actually. The neck feels less rigid now.",
