155216,"A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.
She had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine.

This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently stopped. The introduction and subsequent withdrawal of this medication did not bring about any change in the sustained abnormal contraction of her neck muscles.\nImprovement and subsequent remission of the mood symptoms of the patient provided the treatment team with an opportunity to stop olanzapine. The discomfort in the neck and the abnormal movement of the neck muscles persisted over the next three months’ period when she was off olanzapine without any significant change, even with a trial of propranolol, trihexyphenidyl, and phenargan injection. Reintroduction of olanzapine (at a dose of 2.5 mg per day) after a gap of three months for the reemergence of some behavioral features led to a slight aggravation of the already existing abnormal movement and posturing of the neck.\nWith improvement in the clinical picture, olanzapine was reduced and stopped. She was put on tablet sodium valproate, 1000 mg per day during this period for the stabilization of her mood when she was also given escitalopram for a period of three months for her depressive features. The patient responded well to this change in medication, but she developed amenorrhea for which no cause was established after a detailed gynecological evaluation. Keeping in mind the possibility of valproate-induced menstrual disturbance, she was shifted to tablet lithium 450 mg per day. The patient was well maintained on this medication for a period of around two years. However, she developed hypothyroidism for which eltroxin was introduced at a dose of 50 micrograms per day.\nDuring this period of two years and seven months, the abnormal contraction of the neck muscles and the abnormal positioning of the head improved slightly, and with the improvement, it would cause less discomfort and interference in her activities. However, these movements failed to disappear completely. Another exacerbation of the mood symptoms in the form of mania warranted a need for the introduction of olanzapine (by a different treatment team) and the patient was reintroduced to 10 mg olanzapine on a daily basis, which led to the current presentation as described earlier.\nAfter the case was seen at our institute, the psychotropic medications were stopped as her mood symptoms had remitted and she was put on tablet tetrabenazine (built up to 75 mg per day in divided doses) with which the patient had started showing some response with an improvement in abnormal movements of the muscles of the neck as well as the back. She is now able to stand with support and can do some daily chores on her own. The pain and discomfort in the back and neck have also reduced.\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient has been investigated for the presence of any neurological illness as the cause of her abnormal movements. Her MRI scan of the brain, serum and urine copper levels, slit lamp microscopy for the KF ring, complete blood count, TLC, DLC, and USG of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Her thyroid function tests were deranged subsequent to the introduction of tablet lithium carbonate which was restored to normal after the introduction of tablet eltroxin.\nDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The descriptions of the extent and severity of muscle involvement are variable, ranging from intermittent contraction limited to a single body region, to generalized dystonia involving the limbs and axial muscles.\nEver since the introduction of the term, “dystonia” by Oppenhiem in the early part of the twentieth century, it has been an area of focused attention of the neurologists. In 1973, Keegan and Rajput introduced the term, “” to describe drug-induced, sustained muscle spasm causing repetitive movements or abnormal postures. “” was a term introduced by Burke in 1982, the description of which required the presence of chronic dystonia, a history of antipsychotic drug treatment preceding or concurrent with the onset of dystonia, the exclusion of known causes of secondary dystonia by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation, and a negative family history of dystonia for definitive diagnosis.\nThe dystonia could be classified based on the region(s) of the body involved. Involvement of isolated regions like the face, neck, and arms would be labeled as focal dystonia, whereas simultaneous involvement of two or more contiguous areas would be called segmental dystonia. When the clinical picture is that of involvement of two or more noncontiguous regions, the label used is, “multifocal” and the involvement of one leg and one other body region makes it the generalized type.\nThe symptoms of tardive dystonia could begin even after a few days or weeks of exposure to the offending agent. Tardive dystonia is prevalent in 0.5–21.6% of the patients who are treated with neuroleptics.\nThe syndrome of tardive dystonia has been reported with most of the typical antipsychotics.[] It has been associated with the atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Reports of tardive dystonia developing with the use of atypical antipsychotics have been predominantly in the cases of nonaffective psychosis and in the adult population in the age ranges of the midthirties and forties. Our case is the first case of an affective illness in an adolescent girl developing tardive dystonia on olanzapine. The aggravation of the clinical features with the inadvertent reintroduction of the medication suggests olanzapine is the offending agent. With the growing acceptance of olanzapine as the first-line therapy for the manic phase of bipolar illness and as a mood stabilizer for the maintenance therapy, one needs to be cautious about the emergence of this troublesome adverse effect of this therapy. The patient has shown some response to the introduction of tetrabenazine.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you to the Outpatient department today?
Patient: Good morning doctor, I have some discomfort in my neck and lower back, and I'm not able to maintain an erect posture.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me more about the discomfort?
Patient: Yes, I tend to fall on either side when I stand up from a sitting position, and my head is always turned to the right and upwards.
Doctor: I see. Are you experiencing any pain in your neck?
Patient: Yes, I have pain and discomfort in my neck.
Doctor: Okay. And what about your back?
Patient: There is a sideways bending in my lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of my back and neck, I have to keep my limbs in a specific position to allow my body weight to be supported.
Doctor: I understand. Does this restriction of body movements affect your daily life?
Patient: Yes, I need assistance in standing and walking, and my parents have to help me with my daily chores, including all activities of self-care.
Doctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing these difficulties?
Patient: I've been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since I was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of my exacerbated mental illness.
Doctor: I see. And you've been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, correct?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder seven years ago.
Doctor: And you've been taking olanzapine for your mental illness for seven years, correct?
Patient: Yes, I have. My first episode of the affective disorder was mania when I was eleven, and I've been taking olanzapine tablets in 2.5-10 mg doses per day at different times.
Doctor: I see. So, you developed pain and discomfort in your neck within the second week of being put on olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. The sustained and abnormal contraction of my neck muscles pulls my head to the right in an upward direction.
Doctor: I see. And these features have persisted for the first three years of your illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. The intensity, distress, and dysfunction tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine.
Doctor: I see. And apart from a brief period of around three weeks when you were given trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in your upper limbs, you were not prescribed any other psychotropic medication, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. The rigidity showed good response to trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day.
Doctor: Okay. I'm going to order some tests for you, and I'll be able to give you a proper diagnosis after that.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: I'll also instruct you on follow-up requirements.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor.","{

There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.
On the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.
Because there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor.

The resection was extended 10 cm anteriorly from the tumor and posteriorly it was accompanied by disarticulation of the ribs and partial resection of transversal processes of 8th, 9th, and 10th vertebras.) After that, we have performed a plastic procedure with polypropylene mesh in double layers to correct the defect. The clinical course of the patient was very good and five days later he was discharged from the hospital in very good condition. The conclusion of biopsy for both the tumor of thoracic wall and the lung nodules was sclerosing xanthofibroma which is considered by most people to be a tumor with different clinical and radiological features. Lesions were characterized by a network of anastomosing bone trabeculae without osteoblast lining within a fibrous stroma ().\nReferring to the follow-up, the patient was in a great state of health and from the first month after the surgery he turned back at his work place. Two years after the surgery the thoracic CT-scan showed neither recurrences of the lesions of the thoracic wall nor new developments on the lungs.","Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi doctor, I have this dump pain on my right back and a swelling right there for several weeks.

Doctor: We need to perform a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Because there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology, we decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall.

Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery. However, these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central obesity and muscle mass reduction of the limbs and hot flushes. She was diagnosed with hypertension due to high blood pressure and electrolyte inbalance and prescribed medication. She was suspected of having secondary hypertension, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were conducted. Although echocardiography yielded no specific findings, abdominal CT detected a 2.5 cm benign adrenal adenoma (). The patient was immediately referred to the Department of Endocrinology to be screened for Cushing's syndrome. During screening, a 24-hour urine free cortisol revealed an elevation to 394.3 µg/day (normal, >50 µg/day) and a plasma cortisol level of 29.0 µg/dL (normal, <5.0 µg/dL) was noted based on the results of a 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 21.5 pg/mL (normal range, 6–76 pg/mL) and cortisol levels between 17.3 and 19.9 µg/day in a high-dose dexamethasone test confirmed Cushing's syndrome. A suspected cause was ectopic ACTH-producing tumors due to an adrenocortical adenoma. An in-depth history was then undertaken. The patient disregarded advice to undergo regular monitoring of a small abdominal mass found in a regular check-up done several years before her first visit to our hospital. At the time, she had menstrual irregularity, mild weight gain, depression and intermittent facial skin problems–clinical signs associated with Cushing's syndrome. We determined that asymptomatic AI developed into symptomatic Cushing's syndrome, and the patient underwent laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy after referral to our urology department (). Histopathological examination confirmed cortical adenoma. Six months after the procedure, Cushing's syndrome-related symptoms completely disappeared, including feelings of helplessness and central obesity. The patient is currently under outpatient observation without any specific symptoms.\nThe patient's informed consent and institutional review board's clearance were obtained for the purpose of publication of a case report. This article was approved by Gwangju Veterans Hospital at July 2, 2018 (project number, GVHIRB 18-0023).","Doctor: Hello, what brings you to the hospital today?
Patient: Hi, I have been experiencing pain and restricted range of motion in my left hip joint for two months now. I also have a gait disturbance.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your chief complaint?
Patient: Sure. I have been having severe pain in my left hip that gets worse when I try to flex or rotate it. And my gait is also affected because of the pain.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Can you tell me if you have any lifestyle habits or comorbidities that may have caused this?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Alright. Let me take a look at your physical examination results.
[Doctor examines patient's physical examination results]
Doctor: Yes, it looks like you have a severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain, which is aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. And it also says here that there is no lifestyle habits or comorbidities thought to cause femoral head AVN.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: An anteroposterior view of your left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip. And the magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in your left hip.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: And we also detected femoral head necrosis on the contralateral side, but you didn't complain of any pain.
Patient: That's correct.
Doctor: So, based on the results, we diagnosed you with idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. And you underwent THA for treatment.
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: And it says here that you were discharged in good condition three weeks after the surgery without specific complications, and you followed up via regular outpatient visits.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: But then, you complained of pain and limited ROM in the contralateral hip joint and gait disturbance one year after the initial surgery. And your symptoms continued for two months and increased over the following three weeks.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And then, you underwent a second THA one year after the first THA of the left hip. And you were discharged in good condition after the surgery without specific complications, and followed up via regular outpatient visits.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: At the time of the second surgery, you were 7 kg heavier than you were at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, signs that were initially overlooked as weight gain.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And then, you complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs, which were aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: But these signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. And one year after the second surgery, you were referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital due to a progressive worsening of central.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.","{

80176,"A 49-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain in the left proximal forearm after a fall. The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.

A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins were removed from the humerus []. A wedge osteotomy of the arthrodesis site was then performed and the fusion taken down (). This was performed at the apex of the arthrodesis site with the humeral cut at 90 degrees to the long axis of the humerus and the ulnar cut at 45 degrees to the long axis of the ulna. The cuts were done in this manner to better accommodate the stems of the prosthesis. Resection of the humerus was greater than normal to allow for appropriate range of motion (ROM) of the elbow without undue tension on the neurovascular structures, which had been in this position for over 30 years. Resection of the radial head was performed as it was markedly arthritic. After preparation of the canals, a Stryker distal humeral replacement system was used to perform the total elbow arthroplasty (MRS (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI)). Intraoperatively, the patient had full flexion and extension of the elbow and full pronation and supination. His muscles were properly tensioned without undue strain on the neurovascular structures. The patient's ulnar nonunion was also addressed with bone graft taken from the resected radial head. He had an uncomplicated hospital course and was allowed full ROM on postoperative day #2. At his 4.5-month appointment, the patient was achieving 0–110° elbow active elbow flexion/extension, as well as nearly full forearm rotation. He was experiencing minimal pain and was happy with the function of his prosthesis. The patient was able to return to work with an elbow brace that he locked at work. Radiographs showed a healed ulna nonunion and a stable total elbow prosthesis without signs of loosening (). Multiple attempts to contact the patient for further follow-up have been unsuccessful.","Doctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name]. I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name]. What brings you in today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have a pain in my left arm after a fall.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the fall and the pain you're experiencing?
Patient: I fell and hit my left arm about three months ago. The pain has been getting worse and I can't move my arm as well as I used to.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. I see from your medical history that you had a surgery on your left elbow for posttraumatic arthritis when you were 18. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Okay. I'd like to do a physical examination to see what's going on. Can you describe the pain you're feeling?
Patient: It's a sharp pain in my left proximal forearm.
Doctor: Alright. I'll examine your arm now. Can you move your arm for me?
Patient: No, I can't. My elbow is fused at 90 degrees and I can only do 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination.
Doctor: I see. Your motor and sensory exam is normal at the hand, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. We have taken some radiographs of your forearm and elbow. They showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: After your fall, you developed a hypertrophic nonunion of your ulnar shaft fracture, and we treated it with a cast for three months. But your motion through the nonunion site worsened, and you were unhappy with the functional limitations of your elbow arthrodesis.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: We discussed the surgical options for the ulna nonunion with you at your clinic visit three months after the fall, and we decided to proceed with conservative treatment for an additional three months.
Patient: Yes, I remember.
Doctor: Due to your prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as the risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of the nonunion and the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would act as an intramedullary device.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position and a posterior incision was performed over your elbow. We had to elevate a prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at your index procedure. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We performed a triceps splitting approach to your elbow joint and multiple buried pins were inserted.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: Is there anything you don't understand or have any questions about the procedure?
Patient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. You'll need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask.","{

31864,"A 24-year-old Yemeni female presented to the endocrinology clinic in April 2017 because of inability to walk and a long history of osteomalacia. She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.
Her condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden.

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I'm here because I can't walk.
Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me a little bit about your history?
Patient: Yes, I've had a long history of osteomalacia. I've been unable to walk for the last 4 years because of severe weakness and pain in my bones.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me more about the pain?
Patient: Sure. I reported that for the last 2 years, I was so weak that I couldn't even turn over in bed. The pain was all over my body.
Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me when your condition started?
Patient: It started when I was a baby. I didn't start walking until I was 2.5 years old. When I started school, I could walk but I couldn't run.
Doctor: I see. And did your family seek medical help for your condition?
Patient: No, we were poor and couldn't afford it.
Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me about your marriage and pregnancy?
Patient: I got married at a young age of 15 and got pregnant soon after that. During my pregnancy, I had difficulty walking and pain in my legs. I needed assistance to rise from a sitting position and was told I would need a cesarean section because I had a contracted pelvis. But I went into labor before I was able to have a cesarean section and delivered vaginally. I developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.
Doctor: Hmm, that sounds very difficult. And how did your condition worsen over the years?
Patient: Over the following years, I had more difficulty walking and needed assistance climbing stairs. I went to several orthopedic surgeons and was diagnosed with osteomalacia. I was given calcium and vitamin D, but there was no improvement. I eventually became bedridden.
Doctor: I see. Were you given any other treatments?
Patient: Yes, I was also given calcitriol in small doses for short periods of time, 0.25 mg daily. But I stopped all treatments when I didn't see any improvement in my condition.
Doctor: I understand. Were you seen by a neurologist?
Patient: Yes, I was. They found that I had a normal nerve conduction study and was told there was no evidence of neurological disease.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have a family history of this condition?
Patient: No, there's no history of this condition in my parents, siblings, or other relatives.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your physical examination when you first presented to the clinic?
Patient: Sure. I was 144 cm tall and weighed 49 kg. I was much shorter than the rest of my family.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your history and examination, it sounds like you have osteomalacia. I'll order some tests to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, please be sure to follow up with me for further instructions.

26809,"We report a 24-day-old female baby who presented with dyspnea and fever. Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.
The procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (
). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (
).
The kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (
). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (
). Initially the gas pressure during the reduction in hernia contents was kept at 6 mm Hg but was then reduced to 4 mm Hg during closure of the defect. A chest drain was left in situ through the 5 mm port site at the end of procedure as there was violation of the pleura.
The baby had uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours and chest drain was removed after 48 hours. Renal ultrasound scan showed a correctly positioned kidney with good perfusion and no signs of obstruction.

How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, my daughter was admitted to the hospital a few days ago.
Doctor: Okay, let me take a look at her report first. So, she's a 24-day-old female baby, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And she presented with dyspnea and fever, is that right?
Patient: Yes, she was having trouble breathing and had a high fever.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Let me ask you a few questions related to her symptoms. Did she have any cough or chest pain?
Patient: No, she didn't have any cough or chest pain.
Doctor: Okay. And did you notice any wheezing or crackles when she was breathing?
Patient: No, I didn't hear anything like that.
Doctor: Alright. The examination showed decreased air entry on the left side, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And the chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest.
Patient: Yes, that's what the report said.
Doctor: And the ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: So, a computed tomography of her thorax was performed, which confirmed the left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland.
Patient: Yes, that's what the report said.
Doctor: And the baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.
Patient: Yes, she was fine after birth.
Doctor: Good. The procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position, right?
Patient: Yes, that's what I heard.
Doctor: And a 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port.

149866,"A 16 years old female patient presented to us with inability to walk on both lower limbs since last 3 months. Earlier the patient was able to walk with a limp and would sway to either side while walking. Three months back patient experienced sudden onset pain in her right groin region while walking and the patient was not able to bear weight on her right lower limb. Then patient was walking with support, bearing weight on her left lower limb. In about a week, patient experienced similar pain in her left groin and was not able to bear weight on either lower limb since then and was left bed ridden. Clinical findings were consistent with coxa vara deformity of bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck. There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance, or altered pigmentation or precocious puberty.
On imaging it was concluded that the patient suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non – union of pathological fracture of neck femur ().

With traction neck was aligned to the head and fixed with a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate. The high riding greater trochanter was aligned with the neck and held with a tension band wire from above and medial to the abductors to hold the greater trochanter aligned.\n2 months later on the left side double lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomies were performed both at the subtrochanteric level to achieve the valgus at the neck – proximal femur shaft junction and to align the distal shaft with the proximal femur. After full correction the head and neck were aligned and the vertical geometry of pathological fracture neck femur was converted into a more horizontal one increasing the chances of union of the fracture. Fixation was done using a 135° Dynamic Richard’s screw with a long side plate to span both the osteotomy sites.\nPost – operatively we achieved a neck shaft angle of 135° on right side and 133° on the left side (). Patient was started on active and passive quadriceps strengthening exercises and after 6 weeks of immobilization toe touch weight bearing was started followed gradually by partial and complete weight bearing mobilization. Follow up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites bilaterally and also at the site of the pathological fracture of neck femur.

Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have been unable to walk on both my lower limbs for the past three months.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me more about this problem? When did it start and how did it progress?
Patient: About three months ago, I started having pain in my right groin while walking. I was limping and swaying to either side. Then, I couldn't bear weight on my right lower limb. 
Doctor: I see. And what happened after that?
Patient: A week later, I had similar pain in my left groin and couldn't bear weight on either lower limb. I've been bedridden since then.
Doctor: Okay. Have you had any other symptoms besides the inability to walk?
Patient: No, just the pain in my groins and the inability to walk.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your symptoms and our clinical findings, it seems that you have a coxa vara deformity of your bilateral hips with a possibility of a bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the femur neck.
Doctor: There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance or altered pigmentation, or precocious puberty.
Doctor: Our imaging showed that you have suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur.
Doctor: The imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of your left tibia.
Doctor: The magnetic resonance scanning of your bilateral hip region showed features consistent with fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur shaft along with a sub-capital fracture of the femur neck, without evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head.
Doctor: All of your blood and serum biochemical tests, such as your hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels, and all of your hormonal studies were within normal limits.
Doctor: Based on all of these findings, we have decided to do both correction of the deformity to realign the head, neck, and shaft, and to achieve valgus at the neck-shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture, increasing the chances of union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur, in one stage, each side at a time.
Doctor: On the right side, we first did an oblique osteotomy from just distal to the greater trochanter.
Doctor: This procedure will help to correct your deformity and realign your bones to allow you to walk again.
Doctor: You will need to come back for follow-up appointments so that we can monitor your progress and make sure that everything is healing properly.
Doctor: Is there anything you would like to ask or discuss before we proceed with the next step?

Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having a normal life and thought that his days were counted in this life. Also, a persistent refusal of any medical advice or explanation for his symptoms and fears was neither related to schizophrenia nor related to mood disorders.\nA diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder was made despite the patient's strong refusal. The family and social history evaluation also revealed a very low socioeconomic status and similar conditions in the family. Interestingly, two of the patient's daughters had similar reported conditions which could raise the suspicion of the possible genetic predisposition that could be triggered by shared environmental factors between him and his daughters. Following this extensive detailed history and evaluation, the treating psychiatrist contacted the department of medical eligibility to make the patient's file eligible again as promised by them with an unlimited eligibility to all specialties and primary care center. For the past twenty-five years of continuous hospital visiting, he has had almost weekly and even daily visits to the primary care. The patient kept complaining of variable symptoms every week and specifically asking for certain lab tests and radiological studies. Also, he successfully convinced some physicians to order a biopsy for him.\nIt is reported that physicians in the primary health care center used different techniques of counseling and they applied the biopsychosocial model to overcome the patient's fears but often failed to reach an achievement as the patient continued to complain of different symptoms and became a burden on the physician's clinic time and the hospital resources. It is also reported that the patient was extremely difficult to handle and convince. In the absence of institution guidelines to deal with such cases, all physicians tended to yield to the patient's persistent complaints and accepted his demands and fulfilled his desires by requesting whatever investigations the patient asked for. Over the years, the patient's investigations have cost approximately $178200 due to the system negligence to such cases. The patient's most requested investigations were mainly invasive radiological studies specifically abdomen and pelvis CT (18 times) and wide range of other invasive and noninvasive studies like chest CT (11 times), brain CT (7 times), chest MRI (4 times), lumbar spine MRI (6 times), and other studies. It is important here to put emphasis on the potential harms of radiation from radiological studies that are frequently requested by the patient in the absence of clear guidelines to be followed by practitioners for that group of patients. In addition, the patient asked for a variety of lab tests including renal profile, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, coronary risk profile, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, thyroid stimulating hormone, prostate specific antigen, free T4 level, and other very wide range of lab tests. Moreover, the patient underwent several biopsies like renal biopsy, prostate biopsy, gastric biopsy, and other different types of biopsies.\nThe patient was abusing the system in which resources and time were wasted. The patient kept overstepping each barrier by the hospital's staff to minimize his burden on the hospital by manipulating staff and deceiving and misleading them by giving incorrect information. Also, he was targeting junior practitioners and disturbing them and even threatened to sue the administration if restricted from health care. Five years ago, an experienced board-certified family physician was shocked when he looked at the patient's file and decided to put an effort to solve this problem by taking some actions. First action considered, after getting the approval from the family medicine department, was to limit the patient's primary care visits to only one clinic and to refer him to the supervising physician himself. Then, building strong and effective patient rapport based on trust and honesty was initiated. After negotiations, the patient agreed to enroll in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for six sessions ninety minutes each. The patient was advised to have a scheduled sleeping time, ensure healthy eating habits with regular physical exercise, be involved in social activities, stay away from stressors like searching web for symptoms, and avoid TV health shows and health magazines during active cycles of disorder. After that, there was an agreement with the patient not to disturb the clinic and he would get to see the physician regularly for checkups every three months.\nAfter five years of implementing the new rules, the patient is still visiting the clinic for regular follow-up and sometimes he breaks the rules and comes regularly to the clinic especially in active cycles of the disorder. On following the patient's condition in the last five years, it is noticed that there is a dramatic decrease in the total financial cost due to the relative decreasing number of visits, less time spent on arguing with the patient, and the filtration of his requests. Moreover, there is a remarkable improvement in the patient's condition because of CBT and relative compliance to health advice. We think that this rare case of extremely persisting illness anxiety is worth reporting because the patient managed somehow to escape attention and made a huge financial burden on hospital resources in the absence of clear guidelines in such conditions. Also, this case provides useful insight for future guidelines development.","Doctor: Good morning, sir. How can I help you today?

Patient: I've been feeling tired and weak, and I've been losing weight.
Doctor: Okay. We'll start by taking a detailed history and documenting your symptoms.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: And we'll also perform some physical examinations to check for any signs of cancer.
Patient: All right.
Doctor: And we'll order some radiological and pathological investigations to rule out cancer.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: After we get the results, we'll create a management plan for you based on the findings.
Patient: All right.
Doctor: The results of the investigations came back and they were all negative for cancer.
Patient: What do you mean? I'm sure I have cancer.
Doctor: I understand that you're concerned, but the tests came back negative.
Patient: I don't believe it.
Doctor: I understand that you're not satisfied with the results, so we've referred you to the Psychiatry Department to be evaluated.
Patient: What do you mean by that?
Doctor: We want to see if there might be a nonorganic cause for your symptoms, either psychological or mental.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The hospital administration has reported your case to the department of medical eligibility, addressing the issue of your continuous visits to the primary health care center with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that your file has been temporarily limited to the psychiatry department, and we want you to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically.
Patient: I'm not happy about this, but I'll do it.
Doctor: The appointment with the psychiatrist has been booked, and a full psychological and social evaluation will be performed.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: The evaluation revealed that you fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder, in which you have a persistent belief of having a serious disease for at least six months.

Patient: I'm okay, doctor.
Doctor: Can you tell me what happened that brought you here today?
Patient: Yes, I have a swelling on my scalp that started a year ago and has gradually gotten worse over the past six months. I had surgery to remove it, but the bleeding started at the beginning of the operation and the procedure was terminated.
Doctor: I see. Did you have any other symptoms besides the swelling?
Patient: No, just the swelling.
Doctor: Okay. And did you have any imaging guidance during the surgery?
Patient: No, I had the surgery under local anesthesia without any guidance.
Doctor: I see. And after the first surgery, did you have any other problems?
Patient: Yes, five months later, the swelling increased and I saw another physician. They performed a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and felt that it was a simple skin lesion that could be completely removed. But when I had the second surgery, I experienced severe bleeding.
Doctor: Okay. And that's why you were referred to our clinic, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me about your physical examination?
Patient: Sure. The exam showed a painful mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in the left parietal region at the vertex level. I didn't have any other complaints except for the esthetic problem.
Doctor: Okay. And what were the results of your neurological examination?
Patient: The results were normal.
Doctor: Alright. After considering all the information, we performed a cerebral MR angiography and found a vascular mass lesion in the left parietal region that was supplied by the branches of the left external carotid artery. But the venous drainage could not be clearly identified.

Initially, the supplying arteries of the lesion were closed, and later the lesion was completely removed along with its nidus.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: The bone underlying the lesion had become.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: So, you need to come back for a follow-up in a few weeks to make sure everything is healing properly. Do you have any questions or concerns?

The lower dental centerline was deviated to the right in relation to the midline and a downward canting of the occlusal plane was observed []. On occlusal examination, the central relation was unattainable. Furthermore, there was early contact in both central occlusion and right lateral movement. A discrepancy in range of mandibular motion was observed. The patient was referred for radiography. The radiographs confirmed the clinical findings. The panoramic radiograph [] showed that the right condyle, ramus, condylar neck, and the body of the mandible were enlarged. There was significant deposition of bone growth on the right mandible, and the bony trabeculation alteration was observed. The size of the right inferior dental canal was normal compared to the left mandibular canal and was displaced. Crowns and roots of the right mandibular molars were larger than the contralateral mandibular molars. The roots of the lower right first and second molars were remarkably divergent. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of the face and skull revealed that the zygomatic and frontal bones, right mastoid process, right half of the mandible and maxilla, maxillary sinus, and associated soft tissues were enlarged [Figure and ]. CBCT also demonstrated thickening the mucosal membrane of the right maxillary sinus [Figure and ]. There was no obstruction in the sinus meatus. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormalities [Figure and ]. 3D skull reconstruction CT image revealed hypertrophy of the right mandible, condyle, TMJ, zygomatic bone, petrous bone, and mastoid process []. The posteroanterior radiograph [] revealed enlargement of right half of the mandible, maxilla, and zygoma. The patient was referred to physician. Physician consultation reported systemic abnormality. Blood investigations were within normal limits. Depending on the clinical and radiographic abnormalities were thus consistent with the diagnosis of a hemifacial hypertrophy and fibrous hyperplasia. The patient was referred to oral surgeon. Surgical recontouring of right maxillary and mandibular bone was performed. After 6 months, condylectomy was performed for the right condyle; the size of the condyle was 5 cm × 3 cm []. The mouth opening was significantly increased to 4 cm.","1.

92167,"A 64-year-old Caucasian man from Austria was referred to the urological department because of episodes of intermittent gross hematuria. The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before.

A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U.

42234,"The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4.

A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens were noted to have flow within them with the true lumen supplying the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery and the false lumen supplying the left renal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Immediately below the inferior mesenteric artery the false lumen obliterated.\nAn immediate opinion was sought at the regional cardiothoracic unit and the patient was transferred urgently under their care. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which confirmed the CT findings demonstrating turbulent flow in the ascending aorta suggestive of an intimal tear in the region although the lesion itself was not seen. The arch was mildly dilated but with no visible flap. Flow in the descending aorta was turbulent in the initial 2–3 cm suggesting intimal disruption.\nHe underwent operative repair of the thoracic dissection on the next available theatre list. The aortic valve was resuspended and the ascending aorta were replaced using an elephant trunk graft with reimplantation of the brachiocephalic artery on 1 patch and the left common carotid and subclavian arteries on a second patch.\nAfter 48 hours in the intensive care unit the patient was transferred to the ward where he made an uneventful recovery. Cardiac and cerebral functions were not impaired by the procedure as evidenced by return to preoperative state and no requirements for chronotropic medications.\nA routine postoperative CT scan demonstrated that the repair was satisfactory. There was thrombosis within the false lumen of the descending aorta but persistence of flow within both lumens of the abdominal aorta.","Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?
Patient: Good morning doctor, I have been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past few weeks.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? When did it start?
Patient: It started during coitus and it radiates down my right leg.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Did you see a doctor before coming here?
Patient: Yes, I was referred to a neurosurgeon for an urgent opinion. They thought it might be a disc prolapse.
Doctor: I see. And did you have an MRI scan?
Patient: Yes, I did. The results showed no evidence of spinal cord pathology.
Doctor: That's good news. The findings probably indicate that the pain is musculoskeletal in origin and should settle on its own.
Patient: But the pain has increased in severity and I have claudication-type pain in my right leg after walking about 100 meters.
Doctor: I see. And has the pain resolved after 6 weeks?
Patient: No, it has not. That's why I came back to see my general practitioner.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Can I perform a physical examination on you now?
Patient: Yes, of course.
Doctor: (performing the examination) There's a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which you take relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your heart rate is 68 beats per minute and it's regular. The blood pressure in your right arm is 130/70 mmHg, which is lower than that of the left arm 160/80. Cardiac examination is normal. There's no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. (Examining the limbs) The right lower limb pulses are all absent whilst those of the left leg are present and of good volume.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: I think we need to do an abdominal ultrasound scan to check what's causing the pain.
Patient: Okay, sounds good.
Doctor: (after the scan) The scan has demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta. I would like to arrange a CT scan to confirm the findings.
Patient: Sure, I understand.
Doctor: (after the CT scan) The CT scan has confirmed that the dissection is a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap has been identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: It means that there's a tear in the wall of your aorta, which is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. This is a serious condition and requires immediate attention.
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: You need to be admitted to the hospital as soon as possible for further treatment. I will arrange for you to be seen by a vascular surgical team.

A 7F 4 mm tip steerable ablation catheter was positioned in right and left anterior oblique views. Tachycardia was induced and diagnosis of AVNRT was confirmed by standard protocol. The ablation was performed starting from the inferior lip of coronary sinus and gradually moving anteriorly towards the upper limb of coronary sinus. Intracardiac bipolar electrogram did not show any slow pathway potential near the coronary sinus ostium and at the site of successful ablation (). Just at the upper limb of coronary sinus good junctional rhythm was noted (). A complete lesion at 25-30 watts, temperature of 50ºC for 60 seconds was given. No VA or AV block was observed. Post ablation testing revealed absence of dual physiology and noninducable AVNRT. The patient was discharged on next day and till last follow up after 6 months she was asymptomatic.","Doctor: Hello, how are you today?
Patient: I'm fine, thank you.
Doctor: Can you tell me why you came to see me today?
Patient: Yes, I have been experiencing recurrent palpitations for the last 10 years.
Doctor: I see. How many times have you been hospitalized for the palpitations?
Patient: I have been hospitalized 5 times in the last year.
Doctor: And how were the palpitations terminated during the hospitalizations?
Patient: They were terminated by intravenous adenosine and verapamil.
Doctor: I see. Are you a diabetic or hypertensive?
Patient: No, I am neither diabetic nor hypertensive.
Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me what happened during the physical examination?
Patient: The general physical and cardiovascular examination were normal.
Doctor: I see. And what was the result of the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)?
Patient: The ECG showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval.
Doctor: And what was the result of the electrocardiogram during the tachycardia?
Patient: The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min.
Doctor: I see. And what was the result of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)?
Patient: The TTE did not show any evidence of structural heart disease.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the plan for the electrophysiological study?
Patient: The electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT.
Doctor: I see. And what happened during the catheter manipulation?
Patient: The catheter manipulation led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle, and I required temporary right ventricular pacing.
Doctor: I see. And was there any tachycardia induced during the complete heart block?
Patient: No, there was no tachycardia induced during the complete heart block.
Doctor: And was there any evidence of accessory pathway?
Patient: No, there was no evidence of accessory pathway.
Doctor: I see. And how long did the complete heart block persist?
Patient: The complete heart block persisted for 3 hours.
Doctor: I see. And after that, were you discharged from the hospital?
Patient: Yes, I was discharged from the hospital after 48 hours.
Doctor: And what happened after that?
Patient: After that, I had 3 episodes of tachycardia in 15 days, all terminated with intravenous adenosine.
Doctor: I see. And what was the plan for the restudy?
Patient: The restudy was planned with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury.
Doctor: I see. And what happened during the restudy?
Patient: During the restudy, a catheter was put into the right internal jugular vein, and angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus, which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram.
Doctor: I see. And what was the risk of ablation discussed with the family and the patient?
Patient: The risk of ablation was discussed with the family and the patient, explaining them the risk of development of complete heart block.","{

89642,"A 78 year old Caucasian male presented to our casualty 6 weeks following admission elsewhere with a history of swelling of the right leg and a pulmonary embolus. He had undergone VQ scanning with a proven diagnosis of pulmonary embolus and was therefore anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin.
On admission he had swelling of the right knee and lower thigh with loss of sensation on the dorsolateral aspect of the right foot. Clinical examination revealed a large mass in the right popliteal fossa. The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.
On vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.
The dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm.","A 78 year old Caucasian male presented to our casualty 6 weeks following admission elsewhere with a history of swelling of the right leg and a pulmonary embolus.

She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An examination by the ophthalmologist revealed no ocular injury.
She was transferred to our unit the following day, fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of her facial lacerations. During the procedure it was found that she had sustained an open fracture of her left mandible consistent with a dog bite. (fig ). This was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. (fig ). She had her facial laceration copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. She was discharged home the next day. Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ).

Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ). She will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dentoalveolar development and mandibular growth.","Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. [Name]. What brings you here today?
Patient: Hi, I'm here because of a dog bite I received on my face.
Doctor: Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about the dog bite? When did it happen?
Patient: It happened 30 minutes ago. I received multiple lacerations on my face, including my right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek, and over my left body of my mandible.
Doctor: I see. And have you been examined by the emergency physicians yet?
Patient: Yes, I have. They found no wounds elsewhere, but due to my and my parents' distress, an intra-oral examination was not possible.
Doctor: Okay. And did they perform a radiographic investigation?
Patient: No, they didn't. They thought that I only sustained a soft tissue injury.
Doctor: I see. Did they give you any advice on how to treat the wounds?
Patient: Yes, they did. They cleaned my facial wounds with aqueous iodine solution and started me on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol.
Doctor: Okay. And did you have an examination by an ophthalmologist?
Patient: Yes, I did. They found no ocular injury.
Doctor: Okay. And you were transferred to our unit the next day, right?
Patient: Yes, I was. I was fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of my facial lacerations.
Doctor: Okay. And during the procedure, what was found?
Patient: During the procedure, it was found that I had sustained an open fracture of my left mandible consistent with a dog bite.
Doctor: I see. And how was the open fracture treated?
Patient: It was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws.
Doctor: Okay. And what was done for your facial laceration?
Patient: My facial laceration was copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture.
Doctor: Okay. And when were you discharged home?
Patient: I was discharged home the next day.
Doctor: Okay. And seven days later, you attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of your jaw, right?

Patient: Yes, I was.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the result of the removal of the plate?
Patient: There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications.
Doctor: Okay. So, you will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor your dentition, right?

She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.
Subsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins.

Moreover, argon beam coagulator and fibrin glue were used to seal the raw liver surface and prophylactic cholecystectomy was also performed. Finally, the pancreatic lesion was left intact since malignancy was not confirmed with rapid biopsy.\nPathology report described a hepatic mass with maximum diameter of 6.5 cm which consisted of malignant cells with mild to severe atypia and low to medium mitotic rate. Immunohistochemistry showed that cancer cells highly expressed keratins 8/18, Hep-Par 1 and AFP and did not express keratin 7 and GATA-3 (). Endothelial cells within the mass were positive for CD 34. The gallbladder along with the cystic lymph node was normal. The final diagnosis was low-grade HCC with liver margins widely free from malignant infiltration.–\nThe postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The subdiaphragmatic and subhepatic drains were removed on the third postoperative day without signs of hemorrhage or bile leakage and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Follow-up abdominal CT scanning on the first and sixth month after the operation showed subcapsular hepatic fluid collection without recurrence of the HCC (, right). The patient remains disease free 2 years after the hepatic segmentectomy without any adjuvant therapy.\nWritten informed consent obtained from the patient is for publication of the case details and any accompanying images.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Patient: Good morning, doctor. I came to see you because my symptoms have been getting worse.
Doctor: Okay, could you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I first developed weakness and difficulty using my right arm when I was 16 years old. Over the years, the weakness and difficulty have become severe and symmetrical in both my arms.
Doctor: I see. And did you receive a diagnosis for this condition?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy when I was 25 years old. After that, I had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that confirmed the diagnosis.
Doctor: Okay. Do you have any family members with similar conditions?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright, so you didn't seek any medical care for over 20 years because your symptoms were stable, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And what made you come to see a doctor now?
Patient: Recently, I've been experiencing intermittent pressure pain in my left arm and increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with my left hand. And I also have recurrent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And did you have any bulbar symptoms prior to these recent changes?
Patient: No, I didn't.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for the information. I'll examine you now.
[Examination Happens]
Doctor: I've finished the examination, and I can see that you have significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and weakness. You also have asymmetric focal segmental atrophy of your bilateral forearm flexor and extensor muscle groups, and prominent bilateral brachioradialis muscles.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: And your strength in your upper extremities is measured using the Medical Research Council Scale, and it ranges from 4-/5 to 5/5 proximal strength and as low as 1/5 strength in your distal muscles. You also have bilateral radial deviation during wrist extension.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: Based on the examination and your symptoms, I think it's likely that your muscular dystrophy has worsened. I recommend that you come back for a follow-up evaluation in two weeks.
Patient: Alright, I will.
Doctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask me?
Patient: No, I think that's all. Thank you, doctor.

80727,"A 74 year-old Caucasian woman with complete heart block had dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990. Her initial system included a Medtronic 4504 passive fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4004 passive fixation ventricular lead. She subsequently underwent replacement of her pulse generator in 1998 and insertion of a new Medtronic 5568 active fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4068 ventricular leads in August 2003 due to lead failure. She underwent a subsequent generator change in June 2011. The original atrial and ventricular leads were abandoned when the new leads were added in 2003. All procedures had been undertaken at a referring institution and she had not had any prior open-heart surgical procedures. The patient presented at her home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket in February 2014. Blood cultures did not grow any bacterial or fungal organisms. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed to assess for vegetations on the leads. No vegetations were identified, but there was suspicion that one her atrial lead was extravascular. She underwent chest computerized tomographic imaging and this study revealed that one of her right atrial lead tips was approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space (Figure ). The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on a diagnosis of suspected pacemaker pocket infection. She underwent pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not undertaken due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular. No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.
To minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken. Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed.

No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.\nTo minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken. Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space consistent with likely prior pericarditis. Given the location of the RA lead, care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection until all other vascular structures were exposed. With uneventful dissection of the right atrium, direct visualization of the protruding passive fixation lead was obtained (Figure ). To avoid the risks associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and given the good visualization of the perforating atria lead, an off-pump technique was considered using a “lead-inverting stitch”. To achieve hemostatic control over the region of the atrial wall where the lead exited, a purse-string stitch was placed circumferentially around the lead tip using 3–0 prolene with multiple pledgets (Figure A). The externalized tip of the perforating atrial lead was then mobilized by cutting a rim of surrounding atrial tissue. This allowed the end of the lead to be dunked within the right atrial chamber while the purse-string suture was tightened for hemostasis (Figure B and C). With this “lead inverting stitch”, the lead was free within the right atrium and could now be safely extracted using transvenous laser extraction techniques.\nWith the heart partially verticalized, the lateral wall of the left ventricle was exposed and an epicardial lead (Medtronic 4968) was placed. It was then tunnelled through the subcutaneous tissue above the rectus sheath, secured and connected to the new pacemaker. The new pacemaker was then placed in a newly created pocket, below the left costal margin. The sternotomy wound was covered with sterile surgical towels.\nThe infected pacemaker pocket was then opened and direct visualization confirmed the presence of a small amount of murky fluid. This fluid was sent for culture. The pocket was then extensively debrided and the four transvenous pacemaker leads were prepared for complex extraction in a standard manner beginning with retraction of the distal screw to facilitate separation of the active fixation lead tip from the myocardium interface during laser extraction. A purse string suture was subsequently positioned along the pectoral muscle around each lead at its insertion site to avoid any significant bleeding when the leads are completely removed. The lumen of each lead was then probed for patency with a standard stylet to ensure that a lead-locking-stylet can be utilized and advanced deep into the lead lumen for adequate gripping during the extraction process. Appropriate sizing of each lumen and distal delivery of the locking stylets was subsequently performed. A long silk suture thread was then tied to the outside of the lead near its insertion site, extended along the length of the lead, and tied to its end to provide further support along with the lead-locking-stylet when applying traction on the lead during laser extraction. Now that the leads have been prepared, transvenous lead extraction with a #14 French laser sheath was attempted. Due to the presence of multiple biding sites, up-sizing to a #16 laser sheath was required along with the use of a less compliant outer sheath (Visi-sheath). All the leads were removed entirely, with the perforating atrial lead removed last. There was no hemodynamic compromise throughout the procedure and no mechanical complications related to the procedure. The “lead inverting stitch” retained its integrity and hemostasis was preserved throughout the transvenous lead extraction.\nFollowing successful lead extraction, the median sternotomy and old pacemaker pocket incisions were closed in a standard fashion and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring. The total procedure time from incision to wound closure was 5 hours and 24 minutes. Post-operative course was complicated with hypoxia secondary to atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia that resolved after 5 days. The patient was discharged back to her home hospital for ongoing rehabilitation.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

Doctor: That's great. Can you tell me what brings you here today?
Patient: Yes, I have a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
Patient: Well, I had a dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990 and it was replaced in 1998 and then again in 2003.
Doctor: Okay, and have you had any prior open-heart surgical procedures?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Alright. I see from your records that you presented at your home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket. Did you have any tests done?
Patient: Yes, I did. I had blood cultures and a trans-esophageal echocardiogram.
Doctor: And what were the results of those tests?
Patient: The blood cultures didn't grow any bacteria or fungus, but the echocardiogram showed that there was suspicion that one of my atrial leads was extravascular.
Doctor: I see. And did you have any other imaging done?
Patient: Yes, I had a chest computerized tomographic imaging study done, and it showed that one of my right atrial lead tips was about 2 cm within the pericardial space.
Doctor: Okay. And what was your diagnosis based on these results?
Patient: The diagnosis was a suspected pacemaker pocket infection, and I was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
Doctor: And did you have any procedures done to address the infection?
Patient: Yes, I had a pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not done due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular.
Doctor: I see. And did the debridement procedure and antibiotics clear up the infection?
Patient: No, it didn't. There was a clinical recurrence of the infection and I was transferred to your center for complex lead extraction.
Doctor: Alright. I see that you underwent a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach to minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade due to the chronic right atrial lead perforation. Can you tell me a little bit about that procedure?
Patient: Yes, I underwent a midline sternotomy in a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary.
Doctor: And what was found during the procedure?
Patient: They found dense adhesions within the pericardial space, which was likely due to prior pericarditis. They took care to leave the right atrial dissection.
Doctor: Alright. Well, it looks like you've been through a lot. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss with me today?
Patient: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, doctor.

49286,"We report the case of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both of which were being treated by his primary physician. The patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 owing to a fall and underwent surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the time were focused on the lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used. However, when carefully observed retrospectively, the CT scan showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of the abdominal aorta (). However, there was no mention of localized aortic dissection, because the dissection was fairly localized and did not show any abnormal findings, such as aneurysm formation. In addition, the adventitia causing the aortic dissection was also calcified. The findings suggested a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.
In March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. He had no abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication. On physical examination, palpation of the abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and the patient subsequently consulted his family doctor. After abdominal ultrasound examination, the patient's doctor diagnosed him with an AAA. He subsequently referred the patient to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA. After the enhanced CT scan, the patient was referred to our hospital, where we determined that urgent treatment was necessary owing to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.
Although he did not have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm.

Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was found, but without tenderness at the site. We conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection. Furthermore, a blood culture was performed, and the results were negative. An oral examination was performed considering the possibility that the oral infection had spread to the aorta and become an infectious aortic aneurysm. Multiple cavities and loose teeth were noted. Although not deemed to be a source of infection, the teeth were extracted, and the patient was prescribed an antibacterial to prevent future exacerbation. To rule out other infections, further laboratory work included a complete blood count, renal function, liver function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and IgG-4, all of which were found to be within normal limits.\nA CT scan revealed an irregular AAA with a maximum short diameter of 36 mm within the infrarenal aorta (). Furthermore, part of the abdominal aortic intima calcifications were displaced inward, suggesting aortic dissection.\nA laparotomy was performed by midline abdominal incision. There was no thickening of the arterial wall or retroperitoneal adhesions, as found in inflammatory aneurysms; however, part of the abdominal aneurysm wall was firmly adhered to the surrounding tissue. When the aorta was cross-clamped below the renal artery and the aneurysm was cut open, a partial defect in the intima was observed at the point where CT findings had suggested an aortic dissection. The inside of the false lumen was filled with a dark red thrombus, and a partly organized thrombus was also observed. The aorta was trimmed below the renal artery, and a Y graft replacement (J graft 16 × 8 mm) was performed. The distal side was anastomosed to the common iliac artery on both sides.\nPathologic examination revealed that the medial elastic fibers of the aorta were thin. A vascular lumen was formed by fibrous tissue outside the medial elastic fiber of the aorta. Infiltrating inflammatory cells and macrophages that phagocytosed hemosiderin were found in the surrounding area and wall structure. No elastic fibers were found on the wall of the vessel lumen (). From these observations, it was judged that the vascular cavity was formed owing to the collapse of the wall structure of the aortic aneurysm.\nNo bacteria were detected in the thrombus culture obtained during surgery. One week after surgery, a CT scan confirmed that there were no further complications, and the patient was discharged 8 days postoperatively.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

Doctor: So, the findings suggest a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Can you tell me what happened in March 2020?
Patient: I was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. I had no abdominal pain.
Doctor: I see. And what did the doctor diagnose you with?
Patient: I was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication.
Doctor: Okay. And did you have any physical examination after that?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: Can you tell me what happened during the physical examination?
Patient: Palpation of my abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and I subsequently consulted my family doctor.
Doctor: I see. And after the abdominal ultrasound examination, what did your doctor diagnose you with?
Patient: My doctor diagnosed me with an AAA.
Doctor: Okay. And then what happened?
Patient: I was referred to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA.
Doctor: I see. And then what happened after the enhanced CT scan?
Patient: I was referred to your hospital, where you determined that urgent treatment was necessary due to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.
Doctor: I see. Although you didn't have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm. 
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And upon examination, did we find a pulsating abdominal mass?
Patient: Yes, you did.
Doctor: And was there any tenderness at the site?
Patient: No, there wasn't.
Doctor: Okay. And we conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection, and the results were negative.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And finally, we performed a blood culture, and the results were negative.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: All right. Thank you for your cooperation. I'll see you again soon for the follow-up.
Patient: Okay, doctor. Thank you.","{

In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth.

However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction.\nThe postoperative examination four months later revealed that the bone contours had returned to normal, the asymmetry of the face had disappeared, and the cortical bone thickness had decreased and been remodeled to the previous normal appearance (Figures and ).","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor. I have some swelling and asymmetry on the right side of my face.
Doctor: When did you first notice the swelling?
Patient: It developed about three months ago after an infection.
Doctor: Were you treated with antibiotics for the infection?
Patient: Yes, but the treatment didn't work.
Doctor: I see. You were referred to our clinic because of the swelling?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I need to perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of the swelling. Have you ever had any congenital diseases specified in your medical history?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: During the examination, I noticed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. However, your skin was of normal color and appearance.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: In the oral examination, I found a deep caries cavity in the right mandibular first molar tooth. It wasn't mobile, but there was no other damage to the oral mucosa.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: After a radiographic examination, we found a tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone. This indicates Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of your right mandibular first molar tooth.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that we need to perform endodontic treatment to retain the infected tooth in your mouth. However, as you come from a rural area and cannot afford the treatment, we will need to transfer you to the surgical clinic for dental extraction.
Patient's Family: Is there anything we can do to help with the cost of the treatment?
Doctor: Unfortunately, endodontic treatment is quite expensive and not covered by insurance. Dental extraction will be the most appropriate treatment for your daughter's condition.","{

She also had two inpatient hospital admissions to the psychiatric unit after attempting suicide on two occasions during this episode. During her latest admission, she was treated with different antidepressants and anxiolytics but without any major benefit. Because of the poor control of symptoms of depression, Lamotrigine was added to her other medications (Sertaline and Buspirone which she had been taking for many months). She was started on lamotrigine 25 mg daily which was gradually increased to 50 mg twice daily over the next 2 weeks. Her anxiety and depressive symptoms showed significant improvement on this combination and she started feeling almost back to her normal self. She was continued on this treatment & was discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit on a combination of Lamotrigine 50mg twice a day, Sertaline 150 mg daily and Buspirone 5mg twice daily. At her weekly follow up, she continued showing improvement in her mental state and the treating team was very satisfied with her response to treatment.

At the left side, spectral data for the ECA () and the particular branching which demonstrates that the vessel is ECA indeed were present, whereas there was no Doppler signal and gray-scale findings for the ICA (). Because the left CCA was hypoplastic and there were no findings of atherosclerotic plaques in other arterial segments; it was thought that the left ICA might not be suffering an occlusion at all, but instead it might well be agenetic.

It was finally understood that the patient did not have an occlusion of the left ICA, but instead her left ICA was agenetic. She also had an additional aortic arch anomaly. At the end, it was concluded that an ipsilateral CCA hypoplasia might be taken as a valuable clue in the differential diagnosis of ICA agenesis and occlusion.","Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?

She reports having had three separate left breast biopsies in the past (seven years, four years, and one year prior to her current presentation) for a recurring left breast palpable mass in this same location.
Seven years prior to her current presentation, she presented to an outside community hospital with a palpable left breast mass in the inferior lateral aspect of her left breast. She underwent a left breast biopsy at that time that was reported as showing dense fibrous stroma with fibrocystic changes.
Three years later (four years prior to her current presentation), she noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this showed hyperplastic fibrosis, consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. The pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.
Three additional years later (one year prior to her current presentation), she again noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She again underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this again showed findings consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. Again, the pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon again told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.

James Cancer Hospital, she was found on clinical examination to have volume loss along the entire inferior aspect of her left breast and slight downward tilting of her left nipple and areolar complex. She had three separate well-healed surgical scars along the inferior-lateral aspect of her left inframammary fold (Figure ). Underneath these scars, she had a firm palpable mass, clinically measuring 6.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 cm in size and which clinically appeared to be adherent to the underlying left chest wall structures. She had no clinically apparent adenopathy in her left axilla.\nA mammogram showed scarring and tissue disorganization in the inferior left breast from prior multiple biopsies, but appeared unchanged since a prior mammogram done 13 months previously at an outside community hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left breast showed an intensely enhancing lesion in the inferior-lateral aspect of the left breast, measuring 5.0 × 1.7 cm in size (Figure and ). This lesion appeared to abut the underlying chest wall musculature and appeared to efface the underlying fat plane. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 5.2 × 1.6 cm mass within the inferior-lateral aspect of the left chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the left pectoralis major muscle and left serratus anterior muscle (Figure ). A core biopsy was performed to the palpable left breast mass that confirmed the diagnosis of fibromatosis.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room at to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and underwent a left total mastectomy, with en bloc resection of the underlying musculature (inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) and en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall structures (fourth, fifth, and six ribs, intercostals muscles, and parietal pleura). The left chest wall defect (Figure ) was then closed with a 2-mm DualMesh Gore-Tex patch (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona). The remaining portions of the left pectoralis major muscle was dissected off the underlying left chest wall and its lateral most attachments to the left humerus and superior attachments to the clavicle were divided, allowing it to rotate inferiorly to completely cover the Gore-Tex patch. The left mastectomy site was then closed in the standard fashion. No attempts at cosmetic breast reconstruction with autologous tissue transfer or expander/implant placement were considered at that time. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged to home on post-operative day eight.\nGross pathologic evaluation of the specimen, which overall measured 14.5 × 13.3 × 6.4 cm in size, revealed a 5.2 cm tumor that was grossly invading the underlying attached skeletal muscle to a depth of about 1.2 cm (Figure ). It could not be definitively determined whether the invasion of the underlying skeletal muscle involved only the superficial muscles resected (consisting of the inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) or whether skeletal muscle invasion was to the level of the underlying intercostal muscles resected. However, both grossly and microscopically, there was no evidence of invasion into the bony ribs or underlying parietal pleura. Microscopic evaluation revealed a proliferation of relatively evenly spaced plump spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and associated with mild to moderate amounts of collagen and occasional mitotic figures (Figure ) and demonstrated that the spindle cell proliferations invaded into the adjacent skeletal muscle (Figure ). All surgical margins were negative. On immunohistochemical staining, the spindle cells were negative for S-100 protein, muscle actin (HHF-35), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. On immunohistochemical staining, less than 5% of the spindle cells were positive for Mib1 (Ki-67). The histology and immunohistochemical staining supported a diagnosis of fibromatosis (desmoid tumor).\nThe patient is now 22 months out from her previous aggressive operative management of her previous multiple recurrences of her fibromatosis of her left breast and she remains disease free.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not too good, doctor. I have been experiencing worsening pain in my left breast and chest wall.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I have a recurrent palpable mass in the inferior aspect of my left breast and it's been causing me a lot of pain.
Doctor: I understand. Have you had any biopsies done in the past for this issue?
Patient: Yes, I have had three separate left breast biopsies done in the past.
Doctor: Can you tell me when they were done and what the results were?
Patient: Seven years ago, I had a biopsy done at an outside community hospital and it showed dense fibrous stroma with fibrocystic changes. Then, four years ago, I had another biopsy done and it showed hyperplastic fibrosis, consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. And finally, one year ago, I had another biopsy done and it again showed findings consistent with fibromatosis of the breast.
Doctor: I see. And what did your surgeon tell you about the results of these biopsies?
Patient: The surgeon told me that it was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.
Doctor: I see. And what happened since your last biopsy?
Patient: I have been experiencing persistent and worsening pain and palpable tenderness within the inferior aspect of my left breast and chest wall, with an associated increasing sized palpable mass within the same region.
Doctor: I understand. That's why you presented to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital today, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Okay, I am going to examine you now and we will also need to do some tests to see what's going on.
Patient: Okay.
[Doctor examines the patient]
Doctor: Based on your clinical examination, I can see that you have volume loss.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: I am going to order some tests to see what's causing your symptoms.
Patient: Okay.
[Doctor orders tests]
[Tests results come back]
Doctor: I have the results of your tests. I am afraid I have some bad news. The results show that you have cancer.
Patient: Oh no.
Doctor: I understand this is difficult to hear, but we need to start treatment as soon as possible to give you the best chance of recovery.
Patient: What do I need to do?
Doctor: We will need to schedule some appointments for you to see a specialist and start treatment. I will also give you some instructions on what you need to do in the meantime.
Patient: Okay.","{

67707,"A 26 year old male presented with increasing right knee pain and functional debility with a history of osteochondritis dissecans and having had multiple past surgical interventions. He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.
The patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13. This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing. He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.
Due to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14. Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued. The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm × 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed. It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable. A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation. At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.
Two months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI). The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue. One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy. It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.
At age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy. Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out. The area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst.","A 26 year old male presented with increasing right knee pain and functional debility with a history of osteochondritis dissecans and having had multiple past surgical interventions.

Numerous loose bodies within both the medial and lateral compartments were washed out. The area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst. Unstable edges of the area of MACI graft were debrided but as the entrance to the subchondral cyst was small a surgical decision was made not to further expose nor debride the cavity.\nFailing to symptomatically improve, the patient underwent a further arthrotomy with debridement of the subchondral cyst, after which it was filled with bone graft substitute cortico-cancellous crunch granules. A periosteal flap taken from the medial border of the tibia was then applied over the lesion. The patient underwent a final arthroscopy at age 25 for debridement of an unstable fibro-cartilaginous cap at the site of the past periosteal flap.\nIn total the patient underwent seven separate operations.\nInitial examination upon presentation showed evidence of a moderate right knee effusion. The patient had full range of motion and the knee was stable.\nRadiological examination included both X-Ray and MRI. X-Ray confirmed early degenerative change with intercondylar notch osteophytes consistent with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II. There was noted concavity to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle consistent with the previous area of OCD (Fig. ). MRI showed marked abnormality over the weight bearing portion of the medial femoral condyle measuring 2.3 cm × 1.5 cm. The subchondral cyst had successfully been debrided and grafted and was no longer present on MRI. A thin layer of hyper-intense tissue incompletely covered the area of abnormal cortex (at site of past bone substitute grafting) (Fig. ). The area of pathology had a modified International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score of 4. In addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping indicated significantly elevated values within the thin layer overlying the osteochondral defect but also elevated values within the surrounding cartilage (Fig. ).\nThe patient sought advice regarding further interventions that may improve both his current symptoms but also his long-term prognosis as he wished to avoid progressive degeneration and early joint arthroplasty. After careful consideration and as he now had features of early degenerative change he was assessed as suitable for inclusion in an ethics approved, registered case series on the use of adipose derived MSC therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.\nThe patient was given written information regarding the use of MSC therapy, including relative risks of MSC therapy and also relevant treatment alternatives that could otherwise be explored. Formal written informed consent was obtained prior to commencing therapy.\nAdipose tissue was chosen as a source of MSCs due to ease of harvest, abundance of MSCs and the observed chondrogenic potential of adipose derived MSCs. Bone marrow aspirate was considered an alternative source or MSCs but surprisingly has a relative paucity of MSCs – comprising .001–.02% of the mono-nucleated cell population in comparison to ~1–7% found within adipose tissue [–]. Many studies have indicated similar chondrogenic potential between bone marrow derived and adipose derived MSCs [].\nThe patient underwent an abdominal liposuction harvest procedure. Using a lateral abdominal approach, the subcutaneous fat was infiltrated with an anaesthetic tumescent fluid preparation comprising of 30 mls of 2% lignocaine, 1 ml of 1:1000 adrenaline, 1 ml of 8.4% bicarbonate suspended in a normal saline solution (total 1000 ml). Using a 4 mm lipo-aspirate cannula, 60 mls of adipose tissue and tumescent fluid was successfully harvested and collected within a sterile medical grade single use Shippert Tissu-Trans Collection filter (Shippert Medical, Colorado, USA). The sample was then transferred directly from the theatre via an air lock system to a laboratory clean room facility operated by Magellan Stem Cells (Magellan Stem Cells, Melbourne, Australia).\nAutologous MSCs were isolated and expanded from the harvested adipose tissue using previously published protocols []. The processing of the lipo-aspirate was performed within the environment of a Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Class II using strict sterile techniques.\nStromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained from the lipo-aspirate was culture purified using standard growth media containing Minimum Essential Media Eagle (MEM) supplemented with 2 mM glutamate and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (HyClone – GE Healthcare, USA). The cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The adherent cells were cultured until 80% confluency in freshly added growth media. The cultured purified cells were then harvested at passage 0 (P0). These cells were further plated to tissue culture flasks and expanded up to passage 2 (P2). The cells were harvested and analyzed for cell count and viability using a Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, USA). The harvested cells were washed three times to remove FBS and cryopreserved in cryovials using clinical grade qualified MSC cryoprotectant media and following a previously validated control rate freezing technique of 1 °C/min [, ]. The cryovials were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage until use.\nAt completion of isolation and expansion, the cells underwent independent phenotypic analysis at Monash University and were characterised by flow cytometry using Florescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Using standards established by the Internal Society of Cellular Therapy, the cells were assessed for the presence of positive surface markers CD 90, CD 73 and CD 105 and absence of hematopoetic surface markers CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD45 [] (Tables - and Fig. ). A further sample was sent for independent sterility testing for microbial growth.\nPrior to the intra-articular injection the cryopreserved cells were retrieved from the liquid nitrogen Dewar and thawed quickly within a sterile 37 °C water bath. The thawed cells were then washed in chilled PBS to remove cryoprotectant media, centrifuged and the resultant cell pellet re-suspended in clinical grade 0.9% normal saline. The cells were again analyzed for cell count and viability post thaw using the Muse Cell Analyzer. The cells were injected within 30 min of thawing.\nThe patient received a total of 118 million MSCs (viability 98%) suspended in 3mls of normal saline at commencement of therapy. A second injection of 50 million MSCs (viability 95%) at 6 months was also given.\nAt both injection time points the patient’s right knee was prepped using a chlorhexidine solution and draped. 2 mls of 1% lignocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously at the site of injection. Using a supero-lateral approach to the patella, and under sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance, the MSCs suspended in 3 mls of normal saline were injected into the intra-articular space.\nAfter the initial injection the patient was fitted with a medial compartment customised unloading knee brace to allow protected but full weight-bearing. This was achieved using an Ossur OA Unloader One brace (Ossur, Reykjavic, Iceland).\nThe patient was given post injection instructions, which included range of motion exercises and lower limb muscle activation exercises, and encouraged to perform repetitive low impact and low load exercises against minimal resistance on a stationary bike (continuous active motion versus continuous passive motion). This protocol was developed due to previously published evidence which has indicated the benefit of controlled load on cartilage health [].\nImportantly, recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previous clinical papers investigating the use of mesenchymal stem cell therapy – both intravascular and intra-articular applications – and including autologous, allogeneic and expanded MSC preparations has indicated that MSC therapy is safe. No adverse events including infection, death or malignancy have been recorded.\nSaw and colleagues have documented a self-limited flare up with discomfort and swelling following intra-articular MSC therapy []. This was not considered a serious adverse event.\nRelative risks of the liposuction harvest procedure include infection, bruising and post operative discomfort. Whilst the risk of infection is low, the patient received a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure as part of accepted routine clinical practice [].\nProspective analysis of patient outcome to intra-articular MSC therapy included the following measures:The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). This is a validated scoring system intended for the assessment of knee injury that may result in post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis. The score consists of 5 subscales - pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life. Standardised answers to questions are given (5 Likert scale) and each question is assigned a score of 0–4. A normalized score is calculated for each subscale (100 indicates no symptoms and 0 indicates maximum symptoms) []. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC Index 3.0). This score is a validated quality of life score and quantitatively assesses the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis []. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The patient rates their knee pain intensity over the previous week on a scale of 0–10. The NPRS has been validated for use in people with knee osteoarthritis [].\nOutcome scores were completed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post commencement of MSC therapy and recorded using the software program Clinical Intelligence (Clinical Intelligence, Melbourne, Australia).\nStructural outcome was assessed using MRI imaging performed prior to commencement of therapy and again at 6 and 18 months post-treatment. Semi quantitative measures of the cartilage defect were obtained using a modified ICRS score []:Grade 0: normal cartilage Grade 1: focal blistering and intra-cartilaginous low-signal intensity area with an intact surface and bottom Grade 2: irregularities on the surface or bottom and loss of thickness of less than 50% Grade 3: deep ulceration with loss of thickness of more than 50% Grade 4: full-thickness cartilage wear with exposure of subchondral bone.\nIn addition to routine MRI protocols, the method of T2-relaxation time cartilage mapping was used. T2 mapping assesses the water content of cartilage by giving a quantifiable value to the ability of free water protons to exchange energy and move through a cartilage matrix []. Observed increased water content resulting in an increased T2 relaxation time is an indication of chondral pathology. T2 mapping has been well studied and is an accepted and validated non invasive measure of cartilage quality [].\nThe numeric pain rating score increased at 1 month from 4 to 5 reflecting an initial self-limiting flare up (see Adverse Events). Follow-up at 6 months however showed a 50% improvement in NPRS from baseline and this had further improved by 75% with a pain score of 1 at completion of follow-up at 18 months (Fig. ).\nKnee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores consistently improved across the period of follow-up (Fig. ). At 6 months the patient’s Symptoms Score had improved by 44% and similarly his Sport and Recreational Score had improved by over 100%. These values showed continued improvement at 18 months. The measure of Quality of Life had improved at 18 months by greater than 400% above baseline.\nReflecting the observed improvement in KOOS, the WOMAC Knee Score showed similar consistent improvement from baseline till completion of data collection. At 18 months, the Global WOMAC Score had improved by over 20% (Fig. ).\nStructural follow-up using MRI at both 6 months and 18 months showed significant increase in tissue covering the extensive OCD of the medial femoral condyle. Observed development of a subchondral plate suggested a layering effect from subchondral bone through to the chondral surface. There was smooth integration with the surrounding native cartilage at the periphery of the OCD (Figs. and ). Using the modified ICRS scoring system as described above, ICRS grade improved from 4 to 1.\nT2 mapping at 6 months returned elevated values at the site of regenerative cartilage, consistent with high water content and immature cartilage (Fig. ). Further analysis at 18 months, however, indicated improved T2 values suggestive of progressive maturation of the regenerative tissue (Fig. ).\nFollowing initial MSC therapy the patient reported swelling and increased discomfort of the treated knee. The knee effusion persisted for 6 weeks. This was managed conservatively with application of ice, a compression bandage and simple analgesia. Due to this observed reaction the second injection at 6 months was reduced to 50 million MSCs (viability of 95%). The patient reported minor swelling and discomfort for 2 weeks, with no additional management required.","Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have been experiencing increasing right knee pain and debility.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your history and what has happened so far?
Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans when I was 13 and was treated conservatively. But the pain recurred and I underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14.
Doctor: Hmm, what did the arthroscopic examination show?
Patient: The arthroscopic probing of the lesion indicated that it was stable, but I failed conservative management and underwent a repeat arthroscopy a year later.
Doctor: I see. And what happened after that?
Patient: The unstable lesion was removed and a chondral biopsy was taken for autologous chondrocyte transplantation. But no healing occurred at the site of the defect.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And what happened after that?
Patient: Two months later, the treating surgeon patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant. The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue.
Doctor: I see. And how have you been feeling after that?
Patient: One year later, I was still experiencing discomfort and swelling of the knee. I underwent a further arthroscopy and it was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, but an inner area had failed to fill completely.
Doctor: I understand. And what happened after that?
Patient: At age 23, due to discomfort and mechanical features of instability, I underwent another arthroscopy. Numerous loose bodies were washed out and the area of the past OCD and MACI graft had failed with exposure of underlying subchondral bone and formation of a large subchondral cyst.
Doctor: I see. That's quite a history. Can you tell me more about your current symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I have been unable to perform any activities that involve prolonged weight bearing and it's becoming increasingly difficult to continue my occupation in allied health care.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your history and current symptoms, I would like to perform some tests to see what's going on with your knee.
Patient: Sure, doctor.
Doctor: After the tests, I can give you a better idea of what's causing your knee pain and debility, and what we can do to help.
Patient: Okay.
[Tests are performed]
Doctor: Based on the test results, it looks like your knee pain and debility are related to your history of osteochondritis dissecans and previous surgical interventions.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: I would recommend some physical therapy to help reduce your pain and improve your mobility. You may also need to take some pain medication and use a knee brace to help support your knee.
Patient: Okay, doctor. What else can I do to help my knee?
Doctor: You should also avoid activities that put too much stress on your knee, such as running or jumping. And you should try to maintain a healthy weight to reduce the pressure on your knee.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing and to make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.
Patient: Sure, doctor. Thank you for your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Patient: Okay, doctor. Thank you.","{

The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

Patient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor. I have some swelling and asymmetry on the right side of my face.
Doctor: When did you first notice the swelling?
Patient: It developed about three months ago after an infection.
Doctor: Were you treated with antibiotics for the infection?
Patient: Yes, but the treatment didn't work.
Doctor: I see. You were referred to our clinic because of the swelling?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I need to perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of the swelling. Have you ever had any congenital diseases specified in your medical history?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: During the examination, I noticed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. However, your skin was of normal color and appearance.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: In the oral examination, I found a deep caries cavity in the right mandibular first molar tooth. It wasn't mobile, but there was no other damage to the oral mucosa.

Doctor: After a radiographic examination, we found a tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone. This indicates Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of your right mandibular first molar tooth.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that we need to perform endodontic treatment to retain the infected tooth in your mouth. However, as you come from a rural area and cannot afford the treatment, we will need to transfer you to the surgical clinic for dental extraction.
Patient's Family: Is there anything we can do to help with the cost of the treatment?
Doctor: Unfortunately, endodontic treatment is quite expensive and not covered by insurance. Dental extraction will be the most appropriate treatment for your daughter's condition.","{

The patient underwent a double-barrel extraintracranial (EC-IC) bypass with the occipital artery and the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery as donors. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she has experienced no further TIAs. The follow-up DSA 3 months later confirmed the patency of the bypasses (Figures -).","Doctor: Good morning, I am Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, I am feeling okay.
Doctor: Can you tell me why you were admitted to the hospital?
Patient: I had retroorbital pain and some mild visual deterioration in both eyes.
Doctor: I see. And have you had any ophthalmologic examination?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: Can you tell me what the examination showed?
Patient: The examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side.
Doctor: I understand. And what other tests did you have?
Patient: I had a magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what did the tests show?
Patient: The tests showed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side.
Doctor: I see. So, what was the treatment option that was considered for you?
Patient: The doctor said that there was no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, but the FD option was considered because the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices, there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways.
Doctor: I understand. And what was done during the procedure?
Patient: The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what was the result of the placement?
Patient: The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA. There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process.
Doctor: I understand. And what happened after the procedure?
Patient: The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids.
Doctor: I see. And when were you discharged from the hospital?
Patient: I was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what was the medication?
Patient: I was taking 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day.
Doctor: I understand. And what happened three months after the procedure?
Patient: I acutely developed a hemiparesis on the left side that lasted 48 hours. Then, I began suffering from transient ischemic attacks.
Doctor: I see. And what did the tests show?
Patient: A DSA disclosed the thrombosis of the FD with occlusion of the ICA.
Doctor: I understand. And what happened after that?
Patient: I continued suffering from multiple TIAs despite the resumption of antiplatelet medications, adequate hydration, and a thorough blood pressure monitoring to prevent hypotension.
Doctor: I see. And what did the CT scan show?
Patient: A perfusion-weighted CT scan demonstrated a significant increase in the mean transit time and a reduction in the cerebral blood flow on the right side.
Doctor: I understand. And what was the final treatment for you?
Patient: I underwent a [Doctor explains the final treatment].","{

90149,"A 63-year-old German man with a long past history of tumours was admitted to hospital. 20 years ago a malignant melanoma had been diagnosed on his right loin and radical excision performed. Due to lymph node metastasis in the left groin the patient had chemotherapy. After some time the patient developed haematuria whereupon renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in the right kidney and a metastasis of the melanoma was found in the left kidney. Partial nephrectomy on the right and complete nephrectomy on the left were performed. The patient had since been free of tumour recurrence until presentation.
A recent chest X-ray showed a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung . Two computer tomography examinations of the chest (fig ) were performed but could not conclusively rule out the possibility of metastasis. It was diagnosed initially as an inflammatory process of the lung. When the shadow failed to change with time further investigations were ordered. This was when a tumour in the right atrium was discovered which was neither haemodynamically nor clinically relevant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest showed a spherical tumour (28 × 27 × 20 mm) attached to the wall of the right atrium.

After careful preparations the lipoma excision was carried out through incision of the right atrium while the patient was supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. The tumour was walnut-sized, yellow, had a smooth surface and was attached to the lateral wall of the right atrium. The excision was performed at the base of the lipoma in the atrial wall. The atrium was then sutured. Afterwards, with the patient now being supported by partial cardiopulmonary bypass, the right lung was inspected. A hard resistance could be palpated in the right lower lobe. Considering the uncertainty of its nature and the use of extracorporeal circulation lobectomy was not performed. A biopsy was performed instead. The pleura was closed and the operation successfully completed.\nThe patient recovered well on the ward and was discharged 9 days after the operation with an appointment for a partial lobectomy at a different hospital. Macroscopical and histological examination of the cardiac tumour showed a tumour measuring 40 × 25 × 20 mm, grey-yellowish coloured on cross section with adequate excisional margin. It was attached to the atrial myocardium which showed signs of interstitial fibrosis. The mesenchymal tumour was capsulated and found to be of variable width and made up of unilocular uniform adipocytes with small nuclei and focal regressive changes as well as focal giant cell granulomas. Thus, the diagnosis lipoma was correct and a good prognosis can be expected. As for the lung tumour a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, as the patient had come from a remote rural area and could not accept such a treatment due to the prohibitive cost, she was transferred to the surgical clinic, where the most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction.\nThe postoperative examination four months later revealed that the bone contours had returned to normal, the asymmetry of the face had disappeared, and the cortical bone thickness had decreased and been remodeled to the previous normal appearance (Figures and ).","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm not feeling too well, doctor. I have some swelling and asymmetry on the right side of my face.
Doctor: When did you first notice the swelling?
Patient: It developed about three months ago after an infection.
Doctor: Were you treated with antibiotics for the infection?
Patient: Yes, but the treatment didn't work.
Doctor: I see. You were referred to our clinic because of the swelling?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I need to perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of the swelling. Have you ever had any congenital diseases specified in your medical history?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: During the examination, I noticed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. However, your skin was of normal color and appearance.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: In the oral examination, I found a deep caries cavity in the right mandibular first molar tooth. It wasn't mobile, but there was no other damage to the oral mucosa.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: After a radiographic examination, we found a tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone. This indicates Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of your right mandibular first molar tooth.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that we need to perform endodontic treatment to retain the infected tooth in your mouth. However, as you come from a rural area and cannot afford the treatment, we will need to transfer you to the surgical clinic for dental extraction.
Patient's Family: Is there anything we can do to help with the cost of the treatment?
Doctor: Unfortunately, endodontic treatment is quite expensive and not covered by insurance. Dental extraction will be the most appropriate treatment for your daughter's condition.","{

92197,"A six year-old boy presented with a congenital anomaly of two upper limbs on the right side [Figures –]. Clinical examination revealed that the superior limb was articulating with the shoulder joint, and the inferior limb laterally attached to the chest wall. Both these limbs on the right side were hypoplastic compared to the left upper limb. The superior limb was approximately 7 cm shorter than the opposite limb (normal side), the superior limb being 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint while the inferior limb was 18 cm from the attachment with the chest wall. The skin over the forearm on the superior limb was shiny and atrophic with very little soft tissue mass compared with the inferior limb which was bulkier with normal-appearing skin. The superior limb was articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint. The scapula was small compared to that on the opposite side. The inferior limb was attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space. The superior limb had a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger. There was synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint was stable. All fingers showed symphalyngism; the middle ray including the 3rd metacarpal was absent. The inferior limb had two fingers and a single bone with which it was attached to the chest wall. Clinically, the superior limb presented a picture of an ulnar hypoplastic hand where there was a stable wrist joint and a fused elbow joint. The inferior limb presented like a radial club hand with instability of the wrist joint. All movements were possible at the shoulder joint level but none were possible at the elbow joint and the wrist joint in the superior limb. Hand function was better in the inferior limb.

The hand flexors were stronger in the inferior limb while the extensors were stronger in the superior limb. The clavicular head of the pectoralis was attached to the superior limb while the sternal head was attached to the inferior limb; the latissmus dorsi was inserted into the inferior limb.\nAn X-ray was taken of the right upper limb [], and color Doppler, and MR Angiography were done.\nThe X-ray [] revealed that the scapula on the right side was hypoplastic and the superior limb had a shoulder joint with elbow joint synostosis.\nColor Doppler study [] showed duplication of the right subclavian artery with separate origin of the inferior accessory subclavian artery. There was a patent radial artery with a inner diameter of 1.7 mm in the superior limb (radial) whereas there was a patent ulnar artery with a inner diameter of 2.0 mm in the inferior limb.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography [] confirmed the findings of the color Doppler and the duplication of the subclavian vessels was found to arise from the infraclavicular level. The duplicated vessels running to the inferior limb were running along the lateral chest wall into the limb; the nerves also coursed along with the vessels.\nOur goal was to transfer the inferior limb to the superior forearm as a neurovascular island, and to recreate the hand without compromising the existing function and vascularity.\nAn encircling incision was made around the inferior limb, the pectoralis major and the latissmus dorsi muscle attachments were divided, and the neurovascular pedicle was dissected and mobilised up to its anomalous origin in the infraclavicular region from the subclavian vessels. The inferior limb was then transferred to the superior forearm.\nZigzag incisions were made on corresponding sides of the skin on the forearm and hand. The transverse metacarpal ligament was created and carpal bones were approximated with nonabsorbable sutures. [Figures –]\nThe postoperative period was uneventful and the existing hand functions [Figures –] were preserved. However, the abduction and external rotation at the shoulder joint was reduced because of the tautness of the transferred neurovascular pedicle and the bulk added at the forearm level.\nPhysiotherapy and re-education in terms of holding objects has been started early. The patient has been kept on regular follow-up and further staged procedures like distraction and synostosis of the elbow joint and debulking have been planned to provide a better functional and aesthetic limb.

Patient: I'm okay, thank you.
Doctor: Can you tell me what brings you in today?
Patient: Yes, I'm here for my son. He was born with two upper limbs on the right side.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what are the symptoms he's experiencing?
Patient: He's having trouble using his right arm. It's not as strong as his left arm.
Doctor: I see. We'll need to perform a clinical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you describe the appearance of the two limbs for me?
Patient: Sure. The upper limb is shorter and thinner than the lower limb. The skin on the forearm of the upper limb is shiny and atrophic. The lower limb is bulkier with normal-appearing skin.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And how long is the upper limb compared to the opposite limb?
Patient: The upper limb is 7 cm shorter, it's 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint.
Doctor: Alright. And how is the upper limb attached to the torso?
Patient: It's articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint.
Doctor: And how is the lower limb attached to the chest wall?
Patient: It's attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space.
Doctor: I see. And what bones are present in the upper limb?
Patient: There's a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger.
Doctor: And what about the joints in the upper limb?
Patient: There's synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint is stable.
Doctor: And what about the lower limb?
Patient: The lower limb has two fingers and a single bone with which it's attached to the chest wall.
Doctor: I see. And what's the stability of the wrist joint in the lower limb?
Patient: It's unstable.
Doctor: And what movements are possible at the elbow joint and wrist joint in the upper limb?
Patient: None.
Doctor: Alright. And what about the hand function in the two limbs?
Patient: The hand flexors are stronger in the lower limb while the extensors are stronger in the upper limb.
Doctor: I see. Alright, based on the examination, it appears that your son has a congenital anomaly in his right arm. We'll need to run some tests to determine the best course of treatment.

88610,"This case study is a product of serendipity. A 27 year old female runner was initially part of an experimental study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. At the time of the study the participant had no leg or spine injuries. The participant was part of the asymptomatic control group. Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children. At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.
Twenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.

At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.\nTwenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.\nNo passive therapy was received by the participant. The participant was encouraged to perform daily weight bearing exercise and range of motion exercises. The participant was running within two weeks of the injury with pain and not at her pre injury level. At two weeks post injury the participant reported that she felt she was functioning at 60% of her optimum. At 8 weeks post injury the participant reported that she was running 95% pain free with little loss of function.\nAn identical testing protocol was used across the 3 experimental days (pre injury, 2 weeks post injury and 8 weeks post injury). The muscle activity of the right gluteus maximus, bilateral lower erector spinae, and right hamstring muscle groups was recorded during right prone leg extension while lying prone on a manual therapy table. The position of the leg was controlled in all planes (no hip adduction/abduction or internal/external rotation) visually by the experimenter. A rig restricting movement or a kinematic analysis system to ensure an identical movement across trials was not used as this is not similar to what occurs during practice. The control of proper form was limited to a visual assessment as this most resembles clinical practice.\nDisposable bipolar Ag-AgCl disc surface electrodes with a diameter of one cm were adhered bilaterally over the five muscle groups with a centre to centre spacing of 1 cm. Raw EMG was amplified 5000 times. The amplifier has a CMRR of 10,000:1 (Bortec EMG, Calgary AB, Canada). Raw EMG was band pass filtered (10 and 1000 Hz) and A/D converted at 2000 Hz using a National Instruments data acquisition system.\nThe prone leg extension exercise was performed five times during each experimental session. The task required the subject to lie prone at complete rest with no movement while the EMG from each muscle was collected for 5 seconds. The subject then extended their straight right leg approximately six inches off the table. The leg was held isometrically for 3 seconds then lowered to the table.\nThe data from each PLE trial was processed in the same manner. The aim of the processing for this study was to determine the order and timing of muscle activation. To determine muscle timing, it is necessary to determine when a muscle is considered active or ""on"". A muscle was considered ""on"" when the level of muscle activity was greater than 10% of the peak muscle activity during the prone leg extension. This method of determining muscle onset was used in the previous study by Bullock-Saxton et al []. The order of activation can then be determined by classifying each muscle as ""on"" when its level of activity exceeds that of its predetermined threshold. Muscle activation time (milliseconds-ms) was referenced to the time of activation of the hamstring muscle. For example, positive values (ms) occurred when a muscle's onset occurred before activation of the hamstring muscle group, and negative values indicated that muscle activation occurred after the onset of the hamstring muscle. The onset of muscle activity was determined for each muscle during each repetition of the prone leg lift. Please note that the EMG activity was not normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). While MVCs are important in the collection of EMG when there is a need for determining muscle amplitude, this was not necessary in the current study because muscle timing rather than amplitude was measured. Normalization would not influence the muscle onset results.\nThe data was processed in the following manner: The raw EMG signal was first full wave rectified, then smoothed using a moving average technique which averaged every 100 points of data with an overlap 98 points. The bias was removed from the signal to allow resting activity to be at 0. The peak muscle activity was found and each data point was divided by this peak muscle activity. In this way, muscle onset could be determined by determining the time when the myoelectric signal exceeded 10% of the maximum. The signal was visually inspected to ensure that no artefact occurred or that the results were biologically feasible.","Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I was part of a study a few months ago and I recently suffered an ankle sprain.
Doctor: Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about the study and your injury?
Patient: Sure, I was part of a study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. And I suffered a right ankle sprain while camping.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And did you have any leg or spine injuries before the study?
Patient: No, I was part of the asymptomatic control group.
Doctor: Okay, and what happened after you suffered the ankle sprain?
Patient: I had X rays and they showed no fractures. And I was encouraged to perform daily weight bearing exercise and range of motion exercises.
Doctor: I see. How did you feel after the injury?
Patient: At two weeks post injury, I felt I was functioning at 60% of my optimum. And at 8 weeks post injury, I was running 95% pain free with little loss of function.
Doctor: That's great to hear. So, did you receive any passive therapy for your injury?
Patient: No, I didn't receive any passive therapy.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And did you agree to have your results published for the second half of the study?
Patient: Yes, I was notified of the risks and benefits of the study and I agreed to have my results published.
Doctor: That's great. And the study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And the same testing protocol was used in the 3 experimental days, right?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And how's your ankle now?
Patient: It's much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. I think we need to perform some tests to determine if the ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the prone leg extension as compared with an injury-free prone leg extension onset timing pattern.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: And we need to keep an eye on your weight too.
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Alright, I'll schedule the tests for you. And please keep doing the weight bearing exercises and range of motion exercises.
Patient: Okay, I will.

This was followed by venous anastomosis between the distal end of the peroneal venae commitantes and a tributary of the left internal jugular vein (end to end). The skin paddle bleeding was also good with a sterile needle prick. Thus, the vascularity was restored with retrograde flow and was well established by the time the intra oral inset was completed [].

Patient: I'm feeling okay, thanks.
Doctor: I see that you have a history of radiation treatment for squamous carcinoma. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yes, I had radiation for a cancer in my left lower jaw.
Doctor: I understand. I see that you are here for a composite resection and reconstruction. Can you tell me more about the procedure?
Patient: I'm not sure, but I think it's a surgery to remove the cancer and rebuild my jaw.
Doctor: That's correct. We will be using a fibula free flap for the reconstruction and the left fibula has been selected for the flap harvest.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: During the procedure, we found that the blood flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after dissecting and dividing it.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: We tried to improve the flow with warm saline, xylocaine solution, and papaverine, but it didn't work.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: So, we had three options. We could open the right neck and use the vessels from that side, use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the left side, or use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with the left facial artery.

Doctor: We decided to attempt retrograde vascularization of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, we completed the arterial anastomosis between the distal end of the peroneal artery and the left facial artery, and the arterial flow was checked.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: The procedure was successful and the arterial flow is now good.
Patient: That's great.
Doctor: Yes, it is. But we need to monitor you closely for the next few days to make sure everything is healing properly.

There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.
When we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer.

Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Doctor: I understand. It must have been difficult for you to manage the home care schedule and chores while also dealing with your disorder.
Patient: Yes, it was difficult at times.
Doctor: Now that we know about your diagnosis, we can work together to make sure you have the support you need. How do you feel about that?

The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?
Patient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.
Doctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?
Patient: Yes, I did. But I have been asymptomatic ever since.
Doctor: Okay, let me examine you physically. (examines patient) I can feel a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. We need to perform a computed tomography scan to elucidate the cause of the mass.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What does the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. We also conducted preoperative laboratory testing which revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.
Patient: Do I need surgical intervention?
Doctor: Yes, you do. The hernia repair must be performed to address the issue. Are you willing to proceed with the surgery?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Great. We performed a classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and we found that it was comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance.
Patient's Family: What was the cause of the hernia?
Doctor: The cause of the hernia is unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
Patient's Family: I see. What happened during the procedure?
Doctor: The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step.
Patient's Family: Was there any complication during the procedure?
Doctor: No, there was no complication during the procedure. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered.
Patient's Family: Thank you for taking care of my family member. What are the follow-up requirements?
Doctor: You will need to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks after the surgery. We will monitor your recovery process and schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure everything is healing properly.","{

117267,"A 50-year-old woman with left breast cancer was referred to the Plastic Surgery Department for immediate breast reconstruction.

Her breasts were large and drooping (), and left nipple areola sparing mastectomy was scheduled. A preoperative computed tomography scan showed the shunt tube, which pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk () and entered into the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle ().
In the selection of the reconstruction method, we thought that abdominal flap would be suitable because implant reconstruction would not achieve morphologically favorable results and because a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap would not have sufficient volume. However, it was considered that the shunt tube might cause difficulty in the elevation of the flaps.
We consulted brain surgeons on the feasibility of the abdominal flap operation and decided to withdraw the tube from the abdominal cavity once, when the flap was elevated, and to reinsert it upon the closure of the donor site.

In the elevation of the flap, a skin incision was first made around the whole circumference of the flap and dissection was carried down to the muscle fascia. The shunt tube was confirmed above the fascia on the left side of the abdomen.

As the shunt tube was placed on the left side, we prepared the pedicle of the DIEP flap on the right side. Although we could have used the penetrating branch on the left side containing the shunt tube, we considered that using the penetrating branch on the right side that had not previously undergone surgical operation would be safer. The shunt tube, which was located on the fascia, was covered with fibrous tissue and was not directly exposed (). However, on the closure of the donor site, the shunt tube was obstructed as it was excessively bent. We, therefore, dissected the tube from the surrounding tissue and temporally withdrew it from the abdominal cavity and re-inserted it 5-cm caudal from its original position by a brain surgeon (). After surgery, the patient had a smooth recovery and we found no signs of increased intracranial pressure or complications of abdominal wall. Partial necrosis of the spared skin of the breast occurred but was successfully treated following a conservative approach.\nSince her breast cancer was less than 1 cm in diameter and classified as clinical stage 1 (T1N0M0), adjuvant therapy after surgery was expected to be unnecessary. Thus, immediate reconstruction was performed. However, a sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive, and broad invasion of the primary tumor was observed in the pathological examination. Therefore, she received postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and there was no recurrence of the breast cancer and her reconstructed left breast showed good shape and symmetry in comparison with the right breast at one 1 year after surgery ().","Doctor: Hi, Mrs. X. I'm Dr. Y, the plastic surgeon who will be performing your breast reconstruction. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
Patient: Sure. I have a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and I have a lumbar peritoneal shunt tube implanted to treat my hydrocephalus.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And how is your condition now?
Patient: It's quite stable with the shunt.
Doctor: Okay. So, you were referred to our department for breast reconstruction after your mastectomy, right?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your mastectomy?
Patient: I had a nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast.

Patient: Yes, I did. I indicated that I desired to undergo DIEP flap reconstruction.

177225,"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.
When we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer.

The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hmm, I'm okay, just a little tired.
Doctor: I see from your medical records that you have been a caregiver for your mother who had end-stage breast cancer. How has that been for you?
Patient: It was difficult, but I was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for my mother.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We encountered some obstacles during home care, but together we were able to provide the care your mother needed.
Patient: Yes, the home care staff was worried about whether my mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members.
Doctor: They also mentioned that you were usually not present during their visits. Why was that?
Patient: I was usually doing the dishes or other chores.
Doctor: I see. Were you aware of your mother's medications or how her clothes were organized?
Patient: Not really, I was focused on the dishes.
Doctor: I understand. The home care staff had some distrust towards you, causing you stress. Did you feel that?
Patient: Yes, it was difficult to communicate with them even when we talked.
Doctor: That's understandable. After a few home care visits, we learned that you were diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Did you know about this?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed, but I didn't want to let my parents know about it.
Doctor: I understand. It must have been difficult for you to manage the home care schedule and chores while also dealing with your disorder.
Patient: Yes, it was difficult at times.
Doctor: Now that we know about your diagnosis, we can work together to make sure you have the support you need. How do you feel about that?
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
Doctor: Great. We will need to inform your family about your diagnosis and plan for your follow-up care.","{

116456,"A male patient aged 62 years reported to our center with the chief complaint of dull gnawing pain and a growth in the mouth [] of 5 years duration associated with difficulty in eating and swallowing. The history revealed that the patient had met with a road traffic accident 5 years back which resulted in injuries to his upper front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face. A few months after the injury, he noticed a small growth on the left side of the upper gums that progressively increased slowly to the present size. There was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before presentation to our department after the patient removed a tooth fragment sticking to the growth. There was a gross asymmetry of face caused by the diffuse swelling involving the lower two-third of the left side of the face. Superoinferiorly, it extended from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and the anteroposterior extent was from the midline to the left preauricular region. The mass was reddish pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface, measuring approximately 10 cm × 6 cm and was protruding from the oral cavity causing inability to close the mouth. The growth was attached to the left maxillary alveolus and palate and not fixed to the buccal mucosa or vestibular sulcus.

Since it was an abnormally extensive lesion, we approached by giving Weber Fergusson with lateral limb modification connected with intraoral vestibular degloving incision to have a complete access of the lesion []. Then, peripheral osteotomy cut was given to facilitate easy release and that the lesion was excised completely out of the maxilla. The raw area was packed with iodoform gauze. Obturator was constructed postoperatively to close the palatal fistula. During follow-up, wound shrunk and obturator was replaced with maxillary prosthesis. The mass was sent for histopathological examination []. The weight of the excised mass was approximately 230 g. The differential diagnosis given for the mass was fibroma, ossifying fibroma, peripheral giant cell granuloma, pyogenic granuloma, fibrosarcoma. The histopathological examination of the soft-tissue specimen revealed fibrous, connective tissue with numerous plump fibroblasts []. Numerous areas showed ossification in the connective tissue. Chronic inflammatory cells and blood vessels were also seen. All of which suggested the mass be a peripheral ossifying fibroma []. Postsurgical recovery was uneventful and the 6 months follow-up revealed no evidence of recurrence.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have been having some pain and a growth in my mouth for the past 5 years.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain and growth?
Patient: Sure. The pain is a dull gnawing pain and the growth is on the left side of my upper gums. It's been getting bigger over the past 5 years and has been causing difficulty in eating and swallowing.
Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I had a road traffic accident 5 years ago and I had injuries to my front teeth, lower lip, and left side of my face. A few months after the injury, I noticed a small growth on my left upper gums.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And did the growth increase quickly or slowly over time?
Patient: It increased slowly over time, but there was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before I came here.
Doctor: I see. And what happened 20 days before you came here?
Patient: I removed a tooth fragment that was sticking to the growth.
Doctor: I understand. Can you describe the appearance of the growth?
Patient: Sure. It's causing a gross asymmetry of my face and it's a diffuse swelling involving the lower two-thirds of the left side of my face. It extends from the infraorbital region to the lower border of my mandible and from the midline to the left preauricular region. The mass is reddish pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface, measuring approximately 10 cm × 6 cm. It's protruding from my oral cavity and I can't close my mouth.
Doctor: I see. Is the growth fixed to your buccal mucosa or vestibular sulcus?
Patient: No, it's not fixed to either of those. It's attached to my left maxillary alveolus and palate.
Doctor: I understand. Is there any surface ulceration or bleeding on the growth?
Patient: No, there's no surface ulceration, but there are bleeding spots distributed randomly.
Doctor: I see. And what about your upper posterior teeth? Are they displaced?
Patient: Yes, they're displaced and attached to the mass on the palatal side.
Doctor: I see. And can you describe the feel of the growth?
Patient: Yes, it's firm and tender with an irregular surface and it's fixed to my upper left alveolus.
Doctor: I understand. We have taken a computed tomography angiogram to check the vascularity of the lesion. Do you know what that is?
Patient: No, I'm not sure.
Doctor: A computed tomography angiogram is a type of imaging that uses X-rays and computer technology to produce detailed images of blood vessels. It helps us to see the blood flow and check for any abnormalities.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: The angiogram showed no irregular feeder vessels, but the imaging showed a soft-tissue shadow with calcifications. The soft-tissue shadow measured approximately 10 cm × 6 cm in size and is not involving your mandible, but is causing destruction of your maxilla in the premolar region.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We have also done some routine blood investigations and serology tests.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Based on the results, I have to tell you that you have an abnormally extensive lesion. We will approach this by giving Weber F.
Patient: Okay, what does that mean?
Doctor: Weber F is a type of treatment plan that we will use to manage your condition. It will involve a series of procedures and follow-up appointments to monitor your progress.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: You will need to come back for follow-up appointments and we will monitor your progress. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Patient: I'm feeling okay. But I have this throbbing pain in my upper left canine tooth.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing?
Patient: Well, I've had occasional pain in this tooth for about a year now. It started after I had orthognathic surgery done on my upper maxilla.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the pain?
Patient: Not really, just the pain.
Doctor: Okay, let's take a look. Can you open your mouth for me?
Patient: Sure.
Doctor: (Examines the patient's mouth) I see. You have pain on vertical and lateral percussions on that tooth.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: I've taken a radiograph of the area and it shows a root injury in the middle third of the root. There's also the possibility of endodontic involvement of the area.
Patient: Oh no.
Doctor: Yes, and there's a periodontal pocket of 9mm probing depth in the distal area of the tooth.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there's a space between the tooth and gum that's deeper than it should be. This can lead to further problems if it's not treated.
Patient: What can I do about it?
Doctor: Well, you were referred to do root canal treatment for the immediate management of pain. And I see that you had the endodontic treatment done.
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: Good. That treatment should have relieved you of acute symptoms and made the periodontal pocket inactive. But I see that you didn't report for the periodontal review.
Patient: I was feeling better, so I didn't think it was necessary.
Doctor: I understand. But now, six months later, you're reporting a painful periodontal abscess and a draining sinus opening in relation to the periapex of the same tooth.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: The radiograph shows fast resorption of the root area in the border of the lesion with an ample alveolar bone loss surrounding it.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the bone around the tooth is losing mass quickly, which can lead to further problems if not treated.
Patient: What can I do about it?
Doctor: Well, you're resisting removal of the tooth and insisting on any treatment to restore your natural teeth as long as possible.
Patient: Yes, I want to keep my natural teeth for as long as I can.
Doctor: I understand. Modified Widman flap surgery along with restoration of the root lesion with glassionomer cement was proposed and you're willing for the treatment.
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: However, I need to explain to you the possibility of treatment failure following root fracture and the recurrence of the pocket following non-adaptation of the gingival tissue on the restorative surface.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: In order to control the inflammatory status of the gingiva and to drain the abscess for a firm and less hemorrhagic area for operation, a closed curettage of the pocket followed by subgingival irrigation will be performed.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means we'll clean out the pocket and rinse it to get rid of any bacteria and debris.

Lateral approach was taken and cancellous graft taken from the same side (right) iliac crest was filled in the interosseous membrane between tibia and fibula by at the site of the fracture, just proximal and just distal to it. Two 3.5 mm cortical screws were passed from the fibula to into the tibia at the site where the graft ends proximally and distally. This was done to make a rigid strut with cancellous graft in the middle (). Patient was put in a long knee brace and advised non-weight bearing for a period of 8 weeks. At two months after bridge grafting good callus was seen bridging the fracture and the patient was given a patella tendon bearing cast and was started on partial weight bearing. Complete union was achieved at 7 months post surgery. The ankle movement was 10 degree dorsiflexion from neutral and 20 degree plantar flexion from neutral position at that time. Patient resumed her activities at 8 months post trauma while screw removal was done at 18 months post injury. The patient was last followed up at 5 years post injury. She was walking full weight bearing and was able to carry out all her activities. The medial soft tissue scar was healthy. Ankle dorsiflexion was restricted to 10° but the plantar flexion was around 50° (). There was no history of pain or discharge from the injury site. The radiograph showed the fracture outline to have a silhouetted appearance with good union on posterior and medial side with good consolidation of the entire area of the bridge graft between tibia and fibula ().","Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. X. What happened to you?
Patient: I was in a road traffic accident. My left leg was crushed under a truck tyre.
Doctor: I see. And how did you feel when it happened?
Patient: I was in a lot of pain.
Doctor: Okay. I need to ask you some questions. Have you given informed consent for publication purposes?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: Good. Can you describe your injury?
Patient: My left leg was crushed and I have a grade IIIb compound fracture tibia with a 20cm by 8 cms wound over the anteromedial side of lower third of tibia, extending over to the medial side of ankle joint and foot.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And was the periosteum exposed in the lower third of the tibia?
Patient: Yes, it was.
Doctor: And was the wound badly contaminated?
Patient: Yes, it was.
Doctor: I see. We did some radiographs of your leg and it showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted. And the fibula fracture was at the same level as the tibia and was a short oblique fracture.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: You presented immediately after the injury and we did debridement within 2 hours of injury. We gave a thorough wash and debrided all dead and devitalized tissue. Then we fixed the fracture using a biplanar external fixator.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We also did wound dressing regularly and gave you intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. Two further debridements were needed and at 4 weeks the wound was healthy enough to perform a cross leg flap.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: At 3 weeks post flap surgery, we had to remove the external fixator due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Radiographs showed that the segmental tibia fragment was showing good union response at the proximal end. However, the distal end appeared to be rounded with attempt to callus formation which is non bridging.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: Abnormal mobility at the fracture site indicated a need to stabilize the fracture. However, the soft tissue condition precluded any form of internal fixation. At that time the fibula fracture was completely united.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: So, we took a decision to do a posterior bone grafting along with bridge fibula grafting to provide additional stability at the non union site. We took a lateral approach and filled cancellous graft taken from the same side (right) iliac crest in the interosseous membrane between tibia and fibula by at the site of the non union.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: So, we will keep monitoring your progress and do follow-up appointments as needed.

197225,"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.
When we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.
After a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis.

The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hmm, I'm okay, just a little tired.
Doctor: I see from your medical records that you have been a caregiver for your mother who had end-stage breast cancer. How has that been for you?
Patient: It was difficult, but I was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for my mother.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We encountered some obstacles during home care, but together we were able to provide the care your mother needed.
Patient: Yes, the home care staff was worried about whether my mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members.
Doctor: They also mentioned that you were usually not present during their visits. Why was that?
Patient: I was usually doing the dishes or other chores.
Doctor: I see. Were you aware of your mother's medications or how her clothes were organized?
Patient: Not really, I was focused on the dishes.
Doctor: I understand. The home care staff had some distrust towards you, causing you stress. Did you feel that?
Patient: Yes, it was difficult to communicate with them even when we talked.
Doctor: That's understandable. After a few home care visits, we learned that you were diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Did you know about this?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed, but I didn't want to let my parents know about it.
Doctor: I understand. It must have been difficult for you to manage the home care schedule and chores while also dealing with your disorder.
Patient: Yes, it was difficult at times.
Doctor: Now that we know about your diagnosis, we can work together to make sure you have the support you need. How do you feel about that?
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.

In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?
Patient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.
Doctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?
Patient: Yes, I did. But I have been asymptomatic ever since.
Doctor: Okay, let me examine you physically. (examines patient) I can feel a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. We need to perform a computed tomography scan to elucidate the cause of the mass.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What does the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. We also conducted preoperative laboratory testing which revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.
Patient: Do I need surgical intervention?
Doctor: Yes, you do. The hernia repair must be performed to address the issue. Are you willing to proceed with the surgery?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Great. We performed a classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and we found that it was comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance.
Patient's Family: What was the cause of the hernia?
Doctor: The cause of the hernia is unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
Patient's Family: I see. What happened during the procedure?
Doctor: The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity.

102059,"A 71-year old man was referred to our clinic for the sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. The pain was located at mid thoracic area, and was positively related to motion. It started 5 days prior to the visit and the neurologic changes occurred the following day. Neurologic examination revealed grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia was present below the level of the xiphoid process. The patient was able to walk with the aid of a cane. He had been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year, and had no other past medical history.
Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken from the other hospital revealed a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression (). Under an impression of the T8 pathologic fracture, we ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis. All laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. Chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs. We discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since the patient presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that planning an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable. Further systemic work ups such as whole body positron emission tomography was planned after confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis. No steroid therapy was performed during the preoperative period.
A spinal embolization was performed prior to the operation. As a small size of the ASA was visualized on the left T8 segmental artery angiography (), only the right T8 segmental artery was embolized. On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10.

On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. Tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord. For this procedure, we resected both T8 roots. The operation was uneventful. No significant changes were observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM) throughout the operation. Immediate postoperative neurologic examination showed no change in neurologic status compared to the preoperative state.\nAround 8 hours after the operation, the patient suddenly became paraplegic. Neurologic examination revealed motor power grade 0 on both lower extremities. Pain sensation was lost below the level of the xiphoid process, but touch sense and proprioception were intact. Under a suspicion of operation site hematoma, follow-up MRI was taken immediately. However, we could not identify any lesions causing the patient's paraplegia. No notable events such as hypotension during intraoperative and postoperative period was identified. Therefore, medical treatments, including hydration and high dose steroid injection, were administered and the patient was put on overnight observation.\nThe patient did not show any neurologic improvements the next morning. We discussed this situation with the neurology and radiology departments and concluded that the neurologic features were similar to ASA syndrome. Follow-up T2-weighted sagittal and axial T-spine MRI revealed a high signal change at the anterior half of the spinal cord around the T8 level which confirmed ischemia or infarction of the anterior spinal cord (). Anticoagulation with low molecular heparin and antiplatelet medication were added. Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored and kept above 70 mmHg to maintain spinal cord perfusion pressure. However, the patient's neurologic status did not recover. One week later, the remaining touch sense and proprioception of both lower extremities had also disappeared. The spinal pathology confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Throughout 6 months follow-up, the patient remained paraplegic without any neurologic improvements.","Doctor: Good morning, Mr. [Patient's Name], I'm Dr. [Doctor's Name]. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, Dr. [Doctor's Name]. I'm feeling a bit better, thank you.
Doctor: I understand you were referred to our clinic for sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing pain in my back for the past 5 days. It's located in the mid-thoracic area and it gets worse when I move.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And when did you first notice the weakness in both legs and sensory change?
Patient: It started the day after I first felt the pain.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. During the neurologic examination, it was noted that you have grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia below the level of the xiphoid process. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. I can still walk with the aid of a cane, though.
Doctor: I see. And I understand that you've been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year. Do you have any other past medical history?
Patient: No, that's the only medication I'm taking. I don't have any other medical history.
Doctor: Alright. We've conducted some tests, including radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging, which showed that you have a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Yes. We also ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis, but all laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. And the chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and the results of the tests, we've discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since you presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization, and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Yes. And after the confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis, we'll plan further systemic work ups, such as whole body positron emission tomography. But no steroid therapy will be performed during the preoperative period.

184092,"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.
The patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step.

In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?
Patient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.
Doctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?
Patient: Yes, I did. But I have been asymptomatic ever since.
Doctor: Okay, let me examine you physically. (examines patient) I can feel a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. We need to perform a computed tomography scan to elucidate the cause of the mass.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What does the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. We also conducted preoperative laboratory testing which revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.
Patient: Do I need surgical intervention?
Doctor: Yes, you do. The hernia repair must be performed to address the issue. Are you willing to proceed with the surgery?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Great. We performed a classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and we found that it was comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance.
Patient's Family: What was the cause of the hernia?
Doctor: The cause of the hernia is unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
Patient's Family: I see. What happened during the procedure?
Doctor: The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity.

Patient's Family: Thank you for taking care of my family member. What are the follow-up requirements?
Doctor: You will need to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks after the surgery. We will monitor your recovery process and schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure everything is healing properly.","{

Doctor: The final pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was a benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: A color doppler ultrasound scan obtained 14 days after surgery showed no evidence of splenic infarction and well preserved blood flow within the spleen without definitive peripancreatic fluid collection.
Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been having some abdominal pain.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your pain? Where is it located?
Patient: It's in my abdomen, and it's been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Well, about 4 months ago I was admitted to the General surgery ward for management. I had come in contact with a high tension electric wire while irrigating my field and got full thickness burn wounds on my right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall.
Doctor: I see. And did you have any other symptoms besides the burn wounds?
Patient: Yes, I also had a perforation of my intestine and there was prolapse of the intestinal loops through my abdominal wound.
Doctor: Okay, that's a lot to deal with. So, you were referred to our plastic surgery unit after 3 days of initial management, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And when you presented to us, you were in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. Do you remember what kind of management you received when you were admitted to the General surgery ward?
Patient: No, I don't remember much. I just remember that they put in a catheter drain through my open abdominal wound.
Doctor: Okay. When you were admitted to our plastic surgery unit, you had necrosis of burned skin and muscles over your right shoulder and abdomen, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And now you're here today because you have a ventral hernia and you would like to have it reconstructed, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Okay. We plan to repair the ventral hernia by applying a synthetic mesh and reconstructing the abdominal wall with a flap cover, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.

174092,"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.
The patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity.

The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","Doctor: Good afternoon, how can I help you today?
Patient: I presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.
Doctor: I see, did you experience any sharp pain when you first developed the abnormality?
Patient: Yes, I did. But I have been asymptomatic ever since.
Doctor: Okay, let me examine you physically. (examines patient) I can feel a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. We need to perform a computed tomography scan to elucidate the cause of the mass.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What does the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. We also conducted preoperative laboratory testing which revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.
Patient: Do I need surgical intervention?
Doctor: Yes, you do. The hernia repair must be performed to address the issue. Are you willing to proceed with the surgery?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Great. We performed a classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and we found that it was comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance.
Patient's Family: What was the cause of the hernia?
Doctor: The cause of the hernia is unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
Patient's Family: I see. What happened during the procedure?
Doctor: The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity.

Patient's Family: Thank you for taking care of my family member. What are the follow-up requirements?

Her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram during the clinic visit revealed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute with right bundle branch block morphology; her 12-lead electrocardiogram 3 months earlier also revealed evidence of underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm.

She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent. Initial venous access and lead implantation was attempted across the left cephalic vein but aborted due to difficulty in delivering the pacing lead into the right ventricular (RV) cavity; the venous trajectory was that of a persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) draining directly into the coronary sinus. Right cephalic venous access was subsequently obtained and to our surprise there was an anomalous venous trajectory on the right implantation side as well (Figure ); on intra-operative venography is was evident that the right brachiocephalic vein drained directly into the left persistent SVC as the patient had an absent right SVC (Figure ). Steering the right atrial (RA) pacing lead into the RA cavity was not very difficult however positioning it in the right atrial appendage required careful manipulation. Once in the RA cavity, the straight stylet of the RA pacing lead was exchanged for the curved “J” stylet and clock-wise torque was applied during further advancement of the lead to direct it anteriorly in the optimal atrial appendage position (Figure ). Positioning the RV pacing lead was a challenge since the pacing lead was gaining atrial access across the coronary sinus (CS) OS which is located very close to the RV inlet however the CS OS directs the lead away from the RV inlet towards the lateral free wall of the RA. We were able to redirect the RV pacing lead into the RV by reflecting its tip off the RA free wall thus looping the lead around into the RA and back into the RV (Figure ); in order to reflect the tip of the RV pacing lead off the RA free wall it is very important to withdraw the straight lead stylet back a few centimeters to ensure the tip of the lead is no longer stiff and thus reduce the risk of atrial perforation. Once across the tricuspid valve, the straight stylet can be advanced further if necessary to guide the pacing lead to the RV apex. Alternative methods that could be attempted to direct the RV pacing lead into the RV cavity in such complex anomalous venous anatomy includes adding significant distal curve to the lead stylet or using one of the curved long venous access sheaths that are typically used for CS OS canulation during cardiac-resynchronization therapy device implantation.\nFollowing pacemaker implantation, the patient was monitored overnight in the cardiac telemetry unit and discharged home the following day. Her symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion resolved following device implant.\nIn this case report, we document our pacemaker implantation technique in a patient with a very rare venous anomaly involving an absent right and persistent left superior vena cava.\nVenous anomalies of the thorax can occur in isolation or association with congenital heart disease (CHD). A persistent left SVC (Figure ) can be identified incidentally in 0.5% of the general population and 4% of patients with CHD. Typically when present the left SVC is alongside a smaller caliber right SVC and the left SVC is usually not associated with a brachiocephalic vein. In the incidental and benign setting, the left SVC drains directly into the coronary sinus; when draining directly into the left atrium, the persistent left SVC is usually associated with CHD with the most common being atrial septal defects and coarctation of the aorta [,].\nAnomalies of the right SVC can include drainage to the left atrium, low right atrial insertion, aneurysmal dilatation, and anomalous left brachiocephalic vein drainage to the right SVC []. Persistent left SVC with an absent right SVC is very uncommon in the general population and occurs in 0.07 to 0.13% of patients who have CHD with viscera-atrial situs solitus [].\nLong-term prognosis in abnormal SVC development is good in the absence associated CHD []. Venous anomalies however can make central venous access and in particular pacemaker lead implantation very challenging; this includes single and dual pacemaker implantation along with cardiac resynchronization therapy whereby the insertion of any lead (atrial, ventricular, or coronary sinus leads) would be challenging due to the unfamiliar venous course which does not conform with the pre-formed shapes of the venous access tools utilized during these procedures. These venous anomalies can also cause procedural challenges in any other types of thoracic and cardiac surgeries especially if the physician is not familiar with the course of the venous anomaly at hand along with other associated congenital abnormalities. Pre-operative imaging with venography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or agitated-saline contrast echocardiography can help identify cases of challenging venous anatomy allowing appropriate operative planning; careful patient selection is warranted given the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity.\nThe pacemaker lead implantation techniques we described above to overcome the challenges of this particular anomalous venous drainage case may not apply or be effective in all patients with similar or differing anatomy. It is therefore essential to evaluate the underlying venous anatomy at hand objectively using intra-operative venography or pre-operative imaging if possible when an anomalous anatomy is suspected. Once the anatomy is clarified, the technique that is the safest and least invasive for a particular scenario should be attempted first. Failure to implant pacing leads intravenously may warrant consideration for surgical epicardial lead implantation. In the setting of failed endocardial defibrillator lead implantation attempts, subcutaneous defibrillators can also be considered.","Doctor: Good morning, how may I help you today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I have been feeling tired and short of breath for a couple of months now.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I feel tired and short of breath when I do physical activities. I don't have any chest pain, heart palpitations, or fainting spells.
Doctor: Alright. And do you have any other associated symptoms?
Patient: No, not really.
Doctor: Okay, I see. Let's check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 148/66 mmHg and your pulse is 48 beats per minute. That's stable.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: I also listened to your heart and found an S4 sound and some cannon A waves in your jugular vein. This could be a sign of heart problems.
Patient: Really?
Doctor: Yes, it could be. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. We also did a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the visit and it showed that you have complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that your heart is not beating normally and it's using a backup system to keep beating. This is called a junctional escape rhythm.
Patient: Oh.
Doctor: We also checked your electrocardiogram from 3 months ago and it showed that you have an underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: We also did a Trans-thoracic echocardiography and it showed that your heart is normal in size and function, but you have some mild degenerative changes in your mitral and aortic valves, which is normal for your age.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: There was no evidence of any metabolic or ischemic problems in your lab results. Based on your age, symptoms, and exam results, it's likely that you have age-related degenerative conduction disease.
Patient: Is that serious?
Doctor: It's not life-threatening, but it can cause some symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. And we can't rule out possible coronary artery disease, but it's very unlikely given your lack of chest pain and other risk factors.
Patient: What should I do?
Doctor: We recommend that you get a permanent pacemaker implanted to help with your symptomatic complete heart block. After the implantation, we will also evaluate you for possible coronary artery disease.
Patient: Okay, I understand. When can I have the surgery?
Doctor: We can schedule the surgery for you as soon as possible. And we will need your informed consent before the procedure.
Patient: Alright, I'll sign the consent form.
Doctor: Great. During the surgery, we will try to access your veins and implant the pacemaker leads. However, there might be some difficulty in delivering the lead into the right ventricular cavity due to a persistent left superior vena cava.
Patient: Is that dangerous?
Doctor: No, it's not dangerous. We will just have to find another way to access your veins.","{

7091,"An 88-year-old male presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks.

In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered. The appendix was clearly visualized exiting the abdominal cavity into the inguinal defect. The appendix and its adhered omentum were then carefully reduced back into the abdominal cavity using intraperitoneal countertension without any rupture or spillage. Due to its densely adherent chronic inflammatory tissue, an incidental appendectomy was performed as there was significant tension on the cecum after placing the appendix back in its anatomical location. There was concern for the development of appendicitis post operatively due to the manipulation performed during the procedure. The appendix was then stapled at its base using a standard gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler and passed off the field. The indirect hernia defect was very small and closed with a medium size lightweight mesh plug. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit the same day as surgery and had no complications from his recovery course. No additional antibiotics were given other than a single prophylactic dose during the surgical case. At his 2-week follow-up, he had no recurrence of his hernia and was doing well. On pathologic examination, there was no evidence of appendiceal inflammation or appendicitis. The periappendiceal fat did exhibit some fat necrosis, however, supporting the chronic periappendiceal adhesive changes.","Doctor: Good morning, sir. How are you feeling today?
Patient: I’m okay, doctor. Just a little bit worried about this bulge in my right groin.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your chief complaint?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I’ve had this bulge in my right groin for about 6 weeks now. At first, it was very painful, but it’s been asymptomatic ever since. I’m not sure what caused it.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Have you had any hernia repair in the past?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I had a hernia repair in 1977, but I don’t remember much about it. I don’t think they used any mesh for the implantation.
Doctor: Okay, let me take a look. Can you lie down on the bed, please?
Patient: Sure, doctor.
Doctor: (after physical examination) I found a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in your right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. I’d like to perform a computed tomography scan of your abdomen and pelvis to see what’s causing the mass.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: (after the scan) The imaging showed that you have a right inguinal hernia and your appendix is inside the sac. Your laboratory test also showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L.
Patient: Is that bad, doctor?
Doctor: No, it’s not necessarily bad. But we need to perform a surgical intervention to repair the hernia.
Patient: Okay, doctor. I’ll do it.
Doctor: (on the day of the surgery) We’ll make a classic oblique incision in your right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: (after the surgery) The hernia was composed of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. We tried to reduce the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity, but the adhesions prevented it. So, we had to make a relaxing incision in the typical transverse fashion in your right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and entered the peritoneum.
Patient: Is everything okay now, doctor?
Doctor: Yes, the surgery was successful. We’ll monitor you closely for the next few days. You may experience some discomfort or pain, but it should subside in a few days.

The patient's past medical records from another hospital demonstrated that his endothelial cells of both eyes presented with a normal shape and numbers under a specular microscope about six years ago. However, endothelial cells were found as indeterminate forms using specular microscopy due to the barrier of stromal opacity at the time of our study. The endothelial cells of the left eye were counted using a Konan Noncon Robo-8400 noncontact specular microscope (Konan Medical Inc., Hyogo, Japan) as 2564 cells/m2. We assumed that the right eye would have a similar amount of endothelial cells and a relatively uniform morphologic pattern as those of the left.\nUltrasound corneal pachymetry (Humphrey Instruments Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA) revealed a central corneal thickness of 658 µm in the right eye and 632 µm in the left. The patient was suspicious for CHSD based upon clinical evidence, and he was scheduled for penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye. A corneal button was sent for light and electron microscopic analysis. There was no problem with corneal wound healing after keratoplasty, and the grafted cornea restored its transparency within two weeks. After 12 months, the corneal graft remained clear, and the patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 50 in the right eye.\nLight microscopy with hemotoxylin and eosin staining revealed a normal epithelium and uninterrupted Bowman's membrane. The stromal lamellae were separated slightly from one another, forming a relatively compact space in between the anterior and the posterior stroma (). No Descemet's membrane or endothelium was detected in the original corneal button, apparently as the result of inappropriate specimen handling. Any infiltration, vessels, inflammatory, or storage material could not be detected.\nElectron microscopy revealed a criss-crossing pattern of corneal collagen fibers with a relatively electron dense and lucent structure and collagen fibers irregular in shape and size (). Keratocytes extended widely through the zone of low filaments ().\nBlood was sampled from the patient and family members for DNA collection and analysis []. DNA sequencing analysis of the decorin gene in chromosome 12q22 was positive in both the patient and his mother. The novel mutation of a heterozygous, nucleoside substitution (c.1036T>G) point mutation in the decorin gene was detected in both patients (). Lumican and keratocan sequence variants, which are closely located within the decorin gene, did not reveal any mutations. The c.1036T>G mutation resulted in a change of amino acid sequence (p.Cys346Gly). However, no genetic mutations were detected in other family members.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?

224,"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.
When we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not.

Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not.

Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.","Doctor: Hello, how are you today?

The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.
An X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.
In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap.

With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

Can you tell me what brings you to the emergency department today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I came here because I have been experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath for the past week.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your chest pain? Where exactly is it located and what does it feel like?
Patient: It's a substernal chest pain and it's associated with dizziness. It's been happening once to two times a week.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have a past medical history of coronary artery disease and I underwent coronary artery bypass graft in 2009 and also had percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting in 2008 to the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery.
Doctor: Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions?
Patient: Yes, I have hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.
Doctor: I see. And have you seen a cardiologist recently?
Patient: Yes, I saw my cardiologist one month ago. He recommended using nitroglycerin more frequently.
Doctor: Okay. And did your chest pain improve after using nitroglycerin?
Patient: Yes, it improved initially but for the past week, the pain has been increasing in severity and radiating to my left shoulder.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, sweating, or loss of consciousness?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Okay. And does your chest pain get worse or better with position or medication?
Patient: No, it doesn't get worse or better with position or medication.
Doctor: Okay. Let's take a look at your vital signs. Your vital signs are within normal limits. That's good. Can you tell me about your physical examination?
Patient: The physical examination was normal, including the cardiac and neurological exam.
Doctor: Okay. I see that you underwent a cardiac catheterization. Can you tell me about the results?
Patient: The cardiac catheterization did not show any narrowing or disease of vessels. My ejection fraction was 65% and the previous grafts and stent were patent.
Doctor: Great. And were you scheduled for discharge?
Patient: Yes, I was scheduled for discharge but then I suddenly developed left-sided weakness and facial droop.
Doctor: I see. We called the rapid response team and you underwent a CT scan with no contrast. The CT scan showed no evidence of any acute or significant intracranial abnormality and no bleeding.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And the neurology team was consulted. They recommended the use of tPA. However, we discovered that your aPTT was higher than the upper normal limit due to the recent use of unfractionated heparin for cardiac catheterization.
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: At this time, the primary team made the decision to recheck your aPTT after one hour since you were still within the therapeutic window for tPA. And the repeat aPTT was within the normal limit.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We will keep you in the ICU for observation and we will monitor your condition closely. Please let us know if you experience any changes or discomfort.
Patient: Okay, I will. Thank you, doctor.

At the age of four the patient started experiencing heartburn occasionally. Five years later dysphagia appeared for the first time. It was an episodal and periodical ailment. He reported a deterioration of dysphagia at the age of nineteen; he mostly consumed liquids and soft consistency meals during that time. Nonetheless, the patient admitted that this esophageal discomfort still was not a constant one and there were time intervals without this ailment. In the past there were also episodes of mild esophageal bleeding. The only one endoscopic esophageal dilatation in this patient took place in 1997; a stenosis was located then approximately 18 cm from incisors. The performed procedure ameliorated swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow test obtained one year after the endoscopic dilatation of the esophagus also revealed esophageal constriction on the same level. In 2014 the patient was diagnosed because of hematochezia and pain in hypogastrium.

The patient refused to undergo coronarography and no more cardiological diagnostic procedures were performed Additional file . On admission to our unit he did not complain of the chest pain. On physical examination he appeared comfortable, afebrile with pulse 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 per minute and the body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 kg/m2. The patient presented blisters, skin reddening and crust formation on the upper and lower limbs. There were also contractures and disabled movement in his hand joints together with a loss of a finger and toenails (Fig. ). The apex of the tongue and left palatine arch were covered by superficial ulcerations. During his hospital stay, performed laboratory tests did not reveal any abnormalities. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a thickening of the esophageal wall at maximum to 7 mm on the level from the fourth cervical vertebra to the fourth thoracic vertebra (Fig. ). A probe of gastroscopy under sedation with benzodiazepine failed due to an esophageal stenosis. An attempt of examination with paediatric endoscope was also unsuccessful. A barium swallow test revealed a narrowing of upper esophageal lumen to 7 mm along the length of 4 cm together with two diverticula on the right side not emptying of contrast. During swallowing other two diverticula appeared which were emptying of contrast (Fig. ). A barium swallow test also showed a noticeable weakening of the esophageal mucous membrane. After the performed investigation the patient was qualified to endoscopic dilatation of esophageal stenosis and endoscopic management of diverticula. However, he did not agree to undergo this procedure during current hospital stay. In our unit the patient was treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and prokinetic drugs administered intravenously, which caused an amelioration of esophageal discomfort. He was discharged in a good general condition with a recommendation of a diet based on soft consistency meals, oral PPI and prokinetic drugs administration and the next follow-up in a month.","Doctor: Hello, how are you today?

122288,"An 88-year-old man was transferred from a referring hospital for descending thoracic aortic injury after attempted pacemaker placement; 3 days prior he was admitted with a transient ischemic attack. He had new onset atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia that prompted pacemaker placement. Left subclavian access was attempted after a pocket was created. After placement of a five French sheath, arterial blood return was noted. The sheath was left in place and the procedure was aborted. The patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to computed tomography (CT) scanner for evaluation of arterial injury. The CT scan revealed direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath. The patient was directly transferred by helicopter to our institution for higher level of vascular surgery care. The patient arrived intubated and sedated with the sheath in place in the left chest covered with a dressing and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output.
The patient was taken to the hybrid operating room in our facility. Bilateral percutaneous femoral access was obtained and a five French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery, and initially, a seven French sheath was placed in the left common femoral artery. We placed two proglide devices in the left access in standard preclose technique as this was our anticipated side of device deployment. At this point, a pigtail catheter was advanced into the ascending aorta and an arch aortogram was performed which demonstrated a direct cannulation of the aortic knob (). We elected to proceed to with stent graft placement to manage this injury as the patient’s comorbidities and advanced age were prohibitive risks for open repair.

Therefore, we selected a 36 mm × 160 mm Valiant thoracic aortic stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) and advanced and deployed the device distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The sheath was removed from the aorta and the device was deployed simultaneously. Angioplasty was then performed with a Coda compliant balloon. Repeat arch and thoracic angiography revealed successful sealing of the injury site and no evidence of extravasation. Additionally, the left subclavian remained patent (). We removed the 24 French sheath from the left femoral access and successfully closed the arteriotomy with the proglide devices. The right groin access was managed with direct pressure. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course. The chest tube output was minimal and serous the remainder of his hospitalization and was removed on post-operative day 4.

The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient’s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.
Five years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed.

Patient: I'm good, thank you.
Doctor: I see here that you came in for a regular checkup, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your checkup, we found a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to evaluate it further to determine what it is.
Patient: Okay, what do I need to do?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Unfortunately, the biopsy samples were too small to make a definitive diagnosis. We suspect that there may be multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, so we'll need to observe you closely.
Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever I need to do.
Doctor: Five years later, your CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. We also found an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: During your clinical course, we didn't find any significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, even with imaging examinations such as CT and MR imaging.

With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hmm, not too good, my knee wound hurts.
Doctor: I see. You were referred to our department to evaluate the wound dehiscence on your left knee with hardware exposure. Can you tell me more about the wound?
Patient: Yes, it's been bothering me for a while now. It's painful and there's some hardware showing.
Doctor: I understand. Do you have any other medical issues or comorbidities that we should know about?
Patient: No, I don't have any other medical problems.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Your general status is good, but I see that you underwent a total left hip arthroplasty before. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, I had severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities, so I had the surgery when I was seventy-four.
Doctor: I see. Eight years later, you presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation. An X-ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. Did you experience any other symptoms?
Patient: No, just the pain when walking.
Doctor: Okay. An MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation), and with this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. How did you feel after the surgery?
Patient: I felt okay at first, but then I started experiencing early symptoms of infection about three weeks after the surgery.
Doctor: I see. The symptoms included high fever, suppuration, no wound healing, and laboratory abnormalities. An attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful, and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned. Do you remember this?
Patient: Yes, I remember the surgeries.
Doctor: In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. You were referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. Do you remember this?

130639,"A 84-year-old female was scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of both hips (). Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height.

Cement was loaded with gentamycin, and the same antibiotic prophylaxis protocol was used. For the second surgery, three out of four samples were positive for the same microorganism. 2 weeks later, the patient was readmitted due to wound drainage of the right hip. Surgical debridement and irrigation with the exchange of the modular components were performed. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started with teicoplanin, amikacin, and rifampicin according to the Infectious Diseases Department’s protocol at our institution. Amikacin was stopped 3 days after surgery because no Gram-negative Bacilli were isolated. All four samples obtained during the debridement were positive for E. faecium 5 days after surgery with identical sensitivity tests as for the first hip. Pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment was then started with amoxicillin and rifampicin. 2 weeks after debridement and 1 month after the first surgery, the patient was again readmitted due to wound drainage of the same right hip. Again, surgical debridement and exchange of modular components were performed continuing with the same antibiotic treatment. For the second debridement, one out of five samples was positive for Propionibacterium acnes. Amoxicilin treatment was followed during 3 months. At 18 months after surgery, the patient had recovered to previous full activity. Blood tests at 18 months showed normal C-reactive protein levels and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/h. In the last X-ray control, there were no signs of loosening (). Patient regained complete gait independence without pain. No further complications were reported.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

41351,"A 60 year old male presented with Staphylococcus aureous infection of his endocardial pacing system. His past medical history was remarkable for mild dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, a biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and several previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and the left subclavian veins. The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, transvenous approach for implantation of a new pacing system proved not to be feasible. Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.
A lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall. It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle. The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle.

Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.\nA lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall. It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle. The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into the pacing box pouch and connected to the pacing box. Defibrillation threshold testing was performed, and the lowest effective threshold was found to be < 10 Jules. The sternum was approximated using interrupted stainless steel wires. Sternotomy and subcostal incisions were closed in layers. The patient had a good post operative recovery and was discharged home on day 4 after the operation. Follow-up studies showed well functioning biventricular pacing system, stable pacing lead positions (Figure ), good biventricular synchronized function, and no pericardial effusion.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling okay, a little bit tired.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me why you're here today?
Patient: I was presented with a Staphylococcus aureous infection of my endocardial pacing system.
Doctor: I see. And what is your past medical history like?
Patient: I have mild dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia. I also have a biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy. And I've had several previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and the left subclavian veins.
Doctor: That's quite a history. So, what was done to treat the infection?
Patient: The pacing leads and box were removed and I was treated with antibiotics.
Doctor: I see. And why wasn't a new transvenous pacing system implanted?
Patient: Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, a transvenous approach wasn't feasible. So I was referred for a surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.
Doctor: I understand. Can you describe the procedure that was performed?
Patient: I had a lower half limited median sternotomy starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. And then a second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy. The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle.
Doctor: I see. And what was done with the leads?
Patient: The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle.
Doctor: And what about the left ventricle?
Patient: Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall.
Doctor: I see. And where was the pacing box inserted?
Patient: It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box, which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle.
Doctor: And what was done after that?
Patient: The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into the pocket.
Doctor: That's a lot of information. Is there anything else you'd like to add?
Patient: No, I think that's everything.
Doctor: Alright. I'll make sure to include all of this information in your file. Do you have any questions or concerns?
Patient: No, I think I'm good.
Doctor: Great. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care.","{

89329,"At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
At the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored.

The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing. Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed and assist in brachytherapy planning [Figure ]. The margins of the resection were involved with tumor, as demonstrated by field biopsies and assessment of the margins of resection. Satellite tumor nodules were present in the resection specimen. Four days after surgery the six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125 (Figure). The dwell time of the implant was 62 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2480 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Two weeks later the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy/day and received a course of treatment and total external beam dose of 5040 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered with two beams using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in March 2000.\nThe patient suffered moist desquamation corresponding to the radiation therapy portal that was predicted based on the treatment and the use of a tissue equivalent bolus material which was placed on the wound on alternating days during her course of external beam irradiation. She was able to return home on the last day of treatment. On routine follow-up, only 4 months after treatment, left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg by less than 1 cm. No corresponding gait problems were reported. Nearly one year after treatment (January 2000) physical examination showed good range of motion at the left knee; however, there was significant valgus angulation. An MR study was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and was noted to show growth arrest laterally and predominantly involving the distal femoral physis [Figure ]. Based on these findings, the family was informed that an epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis would likely be required to prevent additional deformity. Due to the angulatory deformity, an osteotomy of the distal femur would be required. Because of high-dose irradiation and concerns about bone healing, osteotomy and epiphysiodesis were deferred until the three year evaluation was performed. At that time, the patient had a significant valgus deformity. The morbidity of the deformity was such that ambulation was difficult. The patient underwent a closing wedge correcting osteotomy, which was fixed with a contour plate. The patient subsequently fractured the plate secondary to early and unprotected weightbearing (against medical advice). She was placed in a cast and ultimately healed her osteotomy. She continues to have a significant limb length discrepancy and will require future lengthening procedures. She remains without evidence of disease nearly 4 years after treatment.","Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you tell me about your history of pain and swelling about your left knee?
Patient: Yes, I had a fall a year ago and related all my symptoms to that fall. I was seen by my family physician in the emergency room, but there was no diagnosis or treatment.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. And what happened prior to that?
Patient: About a month before that, I was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain.
Doctor: I see. And what did the orthopedic surgeon say about your condition?
Patient: They said I had a valgus posture of both my lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation, and I was walking with a mild limp.
Doctor: Okay. And did they find anything unusual about your knee?
Patient: They said my left knee had no effusion, but it was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, but firm palpation was difficult because of my discomfort.
Doctor: I understand. And what did the plain films show?
Patient: They were normal. But an MR was ordered and it revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of my left knee.
Doctor: Okay. And what did the biopsy of the cystic structure reveal?
Patient: It revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma.
Doctor: I see. And what did the metastatic work-up show?
Patient: It consisted of a nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest, and they were both negative.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the local care team's recommendation?
Patient: They offered amputation because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome.
Doctor: I see. And that's why you were referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the situation when you were evaluated after referral?
Patient: There was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of my left knee. The imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery, equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space.
Doctor: I see. And what did the tumor bed exploration show?
Patient: There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space.
Doctor: Okay. And what was the treatment you underwent?
Patient: I underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel.
Doctor: Okay, I see. I'm going to recommend that you come back for a follow-up appointment in three months to check on your progress.

Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.
An X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.
In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed.

The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap.

She reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness after a period of 24 h without any neurological deficit with a complaint of neck rigidity and headache. The patient had a past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year. Upon interview she recalled a long history of trivial headaches, malaise and low grade fever for the past 6 years, whose severity had never warranted any further investigation. She also had a history of intermittent claudication in her bilateral upper limbs. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Right to left blood pressure discrepancies were detected, measuring at 140/80 from right arm and 160/80 from the left arm.
A CT brain was conducted that revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (). Similar findings were evident in previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus (). Laboratory investigation showed raised ESR upto 40 mm/h and C Reactive Protein was positive. Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery from its origin with slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering (). The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm (). Additional imaging showed bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments. There were extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms (). The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of aorta were normal (). We started the patient on 20 mg prednisone resulting in a reduction of ESR as well as normalization of C Reactive Protein.

Patient: Good morning doctor, I was referred here for a consultation.
Doctor: Okay, let's start with some basic information. Can you please tell me your name and age?
Patient: My name is [Patient's Name], and I am 32 years old.
Doctor: And what do you do for a living?
Patient: I am a housewife and a mother of two children.
Doctor: Okay, I see. Can you tell me what happened that brought you here today?
Patient: I reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness.
Doctor: Hmm, that's serious. Did you regain consciousness after the episode?
Patient: Yes, I regained consciousness after 24 hours without any neurological deficit, but I have a complaint of neck rigidity and headache.
Doctor: I see. Do you have a past history of similar episodes?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of similar episodes dating back 1 year.
Doctor: Okay, and what other symptoms have you been experiencing?
Patient: I recall a long history of trivial headaches, malaise, and low-grade fever for the past 6 years, but their severity never warranted any further investigation.
Doctor: And what about your limbs? Have you been experiencing any problems?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of intermittent claudication in my bilateral upper limbs.
Doctor: Alright, let's examine you now. Can you please remove your clothes and lie down on the bed?
Patient: Sure.
Doctor: (After examining the patient) Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally.
Doctor: We also detected right to left blood pressure discrepancies, measuring at 140/80 from your right arm and 160/80 from your left arm.
Doctor: To get a better understanding of your condition, we conducted a CT brain scan. The results showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there was bleeding in the brain and it extended into the ventricles.
Doctor: The previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus showed similar findings.
Doctor: Our laboratory investigation showed raised ESR up to 40 mm/h and C Reactive Protein was positive.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that your body is fighting an infection.
Doctor: The cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of your left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of your right common carotid artery from its origin with a slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering.
Doctor: The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed a saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm.

Routine blood investigation revealed values within normal range, Patient was negative for Anti nuclear Antibodies suggestive of absence of any auto immune disease. Biopsy specimen of the affected skin lesion showed sclerodermoid tissue reaction suggestive of morphic changes. Radiographic investigation of chest, lateral lumbosacral spine, terminal phalanges of long bone showed no abnormality. Orthopantamograph [OPG] revealed significant findings of asymmetry with thinning of the body of mandible with smaller condyle and coronoid process, short roots on affected side when compared to right side. Crowding and carious tooth was also noted (Fig.). Paranasal sinus view showed hypoplasia of the frontal and maxillary sinus. Posterio- anterior view revealed asymmetry of the jaws. Computed tomography [CT] scan revealed generalized atrophy of the soft tissue of the left hemi face resulting in asymmetry on the left side with deviated nasal septum and marked hypoplasia of the frontal and maxillary sinus. Computed Tomographic scan of brain was normal.\nCorrelating all the investigation with the patient’s history and clinical examination a final diagnosis of Parry Romberg Syndrome was established.

Patient: I've had it for 14 years. It started as a small area of hyper pigmentation on my left cheek when I was 8 years old.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. And what happened next?
Patient: It gradually became worse over time. The atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue caused the disfigurement that I have now.

Doctor: Your hard tissue examination revealed crowding of your teeth with a shift in midline to the affected side and obliteration of your buccal and vestibular sulcus due to tense oral tissue. Your upper and lower arch showed constriction of the arch with multiple carious teeth.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Based on the examination, I think you have a condition that needs to be treated. I will refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor.

On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes.

He underwent a cardiac exercise stress test and an echocardiogram which revealed that patient had a normal ejection fraction but a dilated left atrium along with apical wall motion abnormality.\nPatient then underwent a cardiac catheterization. It did not show any obstruction in the coronary arteries, but did reveal a ""tumor blush"" with neovascularization seen projecting from the left circumflex artery to the ""tumor blush"". (Figure ) Following the cardiac catheterization, patient had a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for any mass or tumor. The CT scan showed a 6 cm solid and likely necrotic mass beginning slightly anterior to the carina and extending caudally posterior to the left atrium. (Figure ) No prior imaging was available for comparison.\nAs it was still unclear whether the mass was originating intrinsic or extrinsic to the heart, so to define it better anatomically, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed. The TEE also showed the large mass, likely extrinsic to the heart, compressing the left atrium. (Figure ) Finally, the patient underwent an open heart surgery for definitive diagnosis and management. During surgical exploration, an extremely hard mass was found on the dome of the left atrium, and on further exploration, the indurated tissue clearly extended to the left atrial appendage, underneath the superior vena cava and past the origin of the right superior pulmonary vein. Frozen sections of the biopsy from the tumor were suggestive of ""Cardiac Paraganglioma"", showing tumor cells arranged in a nest-like (Zellballen) pattern-separated by thin vascular network. (Figure ) This was later confirmed further with special staining. The patient's tumor was initially deemed unresectable, because of its location and local invasion, by the operating surgeon and the median sternotomy incision was closed. However, patient then had a second opinion by a different surgeon who successfully resected the tumor and the patient recovered from the operation without any major complications. His normetanephrine levels which were very elevated before the tumor resection (1447 microgram/24 hours), normalized to 312 microgram/24 hours (normal value 110–620 microgram/24 hours) after the tumor was resected. Five years later he is doing well with no recurrence of the tumor, though he has to use a thiazide diuretic for blood pressure control.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so good, doctor. I've been having chest pain for the past few days.
Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me?
Patient: Yeah, it's a sharp pain on the left side of my chest. It started last night and got worse as the night went on.
Doctor: Hmm, I understand. And was the pain precipitated or aggravated by anything in particular?
Patient: Yeah, it was stress at home that made it worse.
Doctor: I see. And did the pain radiate to any other parts of your body?
Patient: Yeah, it went all the way to my left shoulder.
Doctor: Okay. And was the pain relieved by rest?
Patient: No, it wasn't.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
Patient: Well, I used to smoke, but I quit 10 years ago. I have a five pack-year history of smoking. And I would drink alcohol occasionally.
Doctor: I see. And have you had any chest pains like this before?
Patient: Yeah, I have. I've been having mild left sided chest pains for the past few months. They would occur either with stress or exertion.
Doctor: I see. And did you seek any medical attention for those pains before?
Patient: No, I didn't. The pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes.
Doctor: I see. And are you on any medications right now?
Patient: No, I'm not. And I didn't use any pain relieving medicines for my prior symptoms either.
Doctor: Alright. And when you came to the emergency room, what was your blood pressure?
Patient: It was 165/81.
Doctor: I see. And was that a new thing for you?
Patient: Yeah, it was.
Doctor: Alright. And what were the results of your cardiac and pulmonary examination?
Patient: They didn't reveal any abnormality.
Doctor: I see. And what about your basic laboratory work up?

His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history. He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.
He was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.
The patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft. The greater saphenous vein was harvested endoscopically. After this was performed, a midline laparotomy was performed, extending the sternotomy incision.

Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft. The greater saphenous vein was harvested endoscopically. After this was performed, a midline laparotomy was performed, extending the sternotomy incision. Dissection was carried through the lesser sac until the supra-celiac aorta was identified. The supra-celiac aorta, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were dissected from surrounding tissues. The patient was then systemically heparinized to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of greater than 450 seconds, and following aortic and right atrial cannulation, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Normothermic conditions were maintained. The mesenteric bypass was then performed from the supra-celiac aorta to the celiac artery and SMA with a bifurcated Vascutek® 12 mm × 6 mm Gelsoft™ graft (Terumo Cardiovascular Group, Ann Arbor, MI) in an end-to-end fashion (). After completion of the mesenteric bypass, the patient was cooled to 34°C, and coronary artery bypass grafting was performed with saphenous vein grafts to the first diagonal, first obtuse marginal, second obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary arteries followed by the left internal mammary artery graft to mid-left anterior descending artery (). He was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without inotropic support. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 236 minutes (90 minutes for the mesenteric revascularization), and aortic cross clamp time was 125 minutes, using a single clamp technique. After administration of protamine, drains were placed and the sternum and laparotomy incision were closed. The patient had an uncomplicated course with return of bowel function on post-operative day 3 and was discharged home on day 7 from the combined procedure. The patient was seen in follow-up at 30 and 90 days post-operatively and had no recurrent neurological, cardiac or mesenteric symptoms.","Doctor: Good morning, Sir. How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling okay, doctor.
Doctor: That's great to hear. So, I understand that you were evaluated for inguinal hernia repair. Can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have CAD and I had a stenting done on my left circumflex artery. I also have diabetes and I used to smoke, 80-pack year.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. And you reported a 37 kg weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. And I also have exertional angina that can be relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates.
Doctor: Alright. And I see that you had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia. Can you tell me what the results showed?
Patient: Yes, the results showed severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. And was this confirmed by mesenteric angiography?
Patient: Yes, it was. The angiography showed occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery.
Doctor: I see. And was there any stenosis in the inferior mesenteric artery?
Patient: Yes, there was a 90% orifice stenosis.
Doctor: Alright. And given your cardiac history and symptoms, you underwent coronary angiography, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And the results showed significant left main and 3-vessel CAD, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And your left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease, according to the transthoracic echocardiography, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And I see that you were referred for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Did you experience any slurred speech in the past 2 months?
Patient: Yes, I did have a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months.
Doctor: Alright. And a carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Given your severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. So, the decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And I see that you underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. And you had no neurologic complications, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And you underwent combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And after that, a midline laparotomy was performed, extending the sternotomy incision, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Alright. And the dissection was carried out, is that correct?

The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.
Five years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size.

To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed.

Patient: Okay, what do I need to do?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.
Patient: I understand.

119140,"A 75-year-old man was seen in our orthopedic outpatient clinic with osteoarthritis of the right knee. He experienced morning stiffness, pain on the medial side of his right knee after walking and he had difficulties with full flexion of his knee. Conservative treatment was started with steroid infiltration, 4 cc lidocaine mixed with 1 cc depomedrol. Besides these complaints the patient reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.
On physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination.

He experienced morning stiffness, pain on the medial side of his right knee after walking and he had difficulties with full flexion of his knee. Conservative treatment was started with steroid infiltration, 4 cc lidocaine mixed with 1 cc depomedrol. Besides these complaints the patient reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.\nOn physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination.

Patient: I'm feeling okay, thanks.
Doctor: I understand you have been experiencing some pain in your right knee. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yes, I have been having some morning stiffness and pain on the medial side of my right knee after walking. I also have difficulties with full flexion of my knee.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. We started conservative treatment for your osteoarthritis with steroid infiltration mixed with lidocaine. How has that been working for you?
Patient: It's been helping with the pain, but I still have some difficulties with walking.
Doctor: I understand. Besides these complaints, you reported a bilateral painless swollen calf muscle. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, I noticed the swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago and I have no pain at night and no fever or medical illness.
Doctor: I see. And what was your past medical history like?
Patient: It was uneventful.
Doctor: Okay. During the physical examination, we found that your soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. Can you tell me more about the swelling?
Patient: The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, about 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg, the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle.

201894,"A 81-year old woman was referred to our department to evaluate a wound dehiscence on her left knee with hardware exposure. The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.
An X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.
In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure.

With the need of a suitable and large vessel close to the defect, we opted for an AV loop that was constructed with ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. The femoral artery was found to be very atherosclerotic, but a healthy segment free of calcific plaque on the middle third of the vessel was used to perform the anastomosis of the vein graft in end-to-side fashion ().\nA latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap with a large skin paddle was transferred to the lateral knee defect, and the thoracodorsal artery and vein were anastomosed in an end to end fashion to the limbs of the loop. The flap was properly inset to provide adequate bulk and to avoid dead spaces (). Donor site was closed primarily. Intraoperatively, no incidences occurred and the flap appeared well perfused. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with standard clinical monitoring. Tissue oximetry system (INVOS CO.) was used 72 hours after the surgery. Three drainages were left, two of them in lower limb placed in lateral knee and lateral hip and one in donor area of the flap. Drainages were retained until output was less than 30 ml per day.\nWound healing properly evolved as well as the patient started rehabilitation during admission. The patient received Daptomycin (700 mg/d iv) and fosfomycin (2 g/6h iv) during 6 weeks, according to the infectious medicine protocol. The patient started walking uneventfully with a walking frame one month after surgery. The patient was enrolled in an outpatient rehabilitation program with close monitoring. At present time, the patient is able to ambulance without the need of assistant devices and there are no signsor symptoms of infection recurrence.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

The patient was seen in the department of medicine of our hospital for further evaluation. The patient’s family history was noncontributory, and a physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The results of laboratory studies were either within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, as well as a small nodule (1.2 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung (Fig. ). The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples. The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.
Five years later, a CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging also revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra. To evaluate both the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed. The orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface.

Patient: I'm good, thank you.
Doctor: I see here that you came in for a regular checkup, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your checkup, we found a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to evaluate it further to determine what it is.
Patient: Okay, what do I need to do?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a CT scan to get a better look at the nodule.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: The results of your laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative, which is good. We also didn't find any abnormalities during your physical examination.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: However, the CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in your fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in your right lung. We'll need to biopsy both to determine what they are.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Unfortunately, the biopsy samples were too small to make a definitive diagnosis. We suspect that there may be multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, so we'll need to observe you closely.
Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever I need to do.
Doctor: Five years later, your CT scan indicated that the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. We also found an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
Patient: That doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We'll need to perform video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion to evaluate both.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: During the surgery, the orthopedic surgeons found that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. They also found that the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the tumor is contained and hasn't spread to other areas.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: During your clinical course, we didn't find any significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, even with imaging examinations such as CT and MR imaging.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that you made good postoperative progress and have remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.
Patient: Thank you so much for your help and for taking care of me.
Doctor: Of course, it's our pleasure. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.","{

114489,"An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication. Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity (). Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex. However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means. Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region (). Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision. While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain (). Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries. Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed. The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised. The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery. The patient recovered without sequelae and was discharged after a short while.","An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago.

Patient: Hi, doctor. I have been having a headache since I was tackled during exercise several weeks ago.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what have you done so far to treat the headache?
Patient: I went to a local hospital a few days ago and they did a Brain CT scan.
Doctor: Okay, and what did the CT scan show?
Patient: It showed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity and some calcified nodules at the left frontotemporal cortex.
Doctor: Hmm, that's interesting. And what was the initial diagnosis for the headache?
Patient: The initial diagnosis was a simple traumatic hemorrhage and I was managed by conservative means.
Doctor: I see. And did the headache get better after that?
Patient: No, several days later, the headache got worse and I had an episode of a generalized partial seizure.
Doctor: Okay, and what did you do next?
Patient: I was taken to the hospital again and they performed an MRI scan.
Doctor: And what did the MRI scan show?
Patient: The MRI scan showed that the size of the hematoma and cerebral edema had increased and there was a small enhancing mass at the left cerebral convexity.
Doctor: Hmm, that's not good. And did they perform any other tests?
Patient: Yes, they also did a Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) test.
Doctor: And what did the MRA test show?
Patient: The MRA test showed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what was the next step?
Patient: The next step was to perform an emergency craniotomy to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma.
Doctor: And how was the craniotomy performed?
Patient: They did a large craniotomy and removed the subdural hematoma by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision.
Doctor: Hmm, that's a lot of work. And what happened during the craniotomy?
Patient: During the craniotomy, they encountered several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules that were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain.
Doctor: Hmm, that's not good. And what did they do with the nodules?
Patient: They carefully dissected the nodules and found that they were buried in the sulcus and severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries.
Doctor: And what happened after that?
Patient: After that, they removed the organizing hematoma and exposed a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch.
Doctor: Hmm, that's serious. And what was the next step?
Patient: The next step was to dissect the involved MCA branch and trap it with clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm.
Doctor: And what happened to the aneurysm and the calcified nodules?
Patient: The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised.
Doctor: And how did the patient recover?
Patient: The patient recovered without sequelae because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery and minimized the ischemic injury.
Doctor: That's great news. And when was the patient discharged?

His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().
The decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation.

Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated in the right superior gluteal artery distal to the site of the endoleak. Angiography demonstrated five branches leading from the sacral body, feeding the gluteal artery, and perfusing the aneurysmal sac. These branches were selectively cannulated with a microcatheter and embolised with a variety of Interlock (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), Nestor (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA), and Target embolism coils (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA). Subsequent contrast injection showed only filling of the sac with no further feeding collaterals identified.\nFollowing successful embolisation of all collateral vessels, the main aneurysm sac was then injected with a liquid embolic agent, 1.5 mL of Lipidiol (Guerbet Group, Roissy, France), and 0.5 mL of Histoacryl (Tissue Seal, Ann Arbor, MN, USA). Completion angiography demonstrated no perfusion of the IIA aneurysm sac. Follow-up imaging demonstrated a stable aneurysm excluded from circulation. The patient made an uneventful recovery.","Doctor: Good morning, Mr. X. How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm okay, doctor.
Doctor: I understand that you have been diagnosed with a large right aneurysm. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed during routine surveillance.
Doctor: I see. And do you have a history of endovascular intervention?
Patient: Yes, I had an endovascular AAA repair 9 years ago for a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Doctor: And what happened after that?
Patient: After that, I developed bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms.
Doctor: I see. And what was done to treat them?
Patient: I underwent endovascular repair for the aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, but a rupture of the right external iliac artery happened and I had to have a covered stent placed across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft.

Patient: It showed that the sac had expanded to a diameter of 6.4 cm and the source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in the left iliac system.
Doctor: I see. And what was done to treat the endoleak?
Patient: Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left-sided femoral artery puncture, but it was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, so endovascular treatment was not possible.

155425,"A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a local clinic for decreased visual acuity in her left eye. Two hours before the manifestation of symptoms, an autologous fat injection was administered in the periocular area under intravenous anesthesia.

When the effect of the anesthesia wore off, the patient reported a loss of vision in the left eye. The best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and no light perception on the left side. The left pupil was dilated and a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected. During physical examination, the patient suddenly complained of dysarthria and the skin color of the nose changed to purple (). The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency room and neurological examination, blood tests, and an MRI scan of the brain were performed. Within 30 minutes, the dysarthria improved significantly and the patient was able to speak normally. On examination, the right fundus appeared to be normal but the left showed a cherry red spot with visible emboli in several retinal arteries ().

123768,"A 55-year-old female presented to the ophthalmology department of the hospital with complaints of a painful swelling in the left eye. The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.
On examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated. The patient had no perception of light in the left eye. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in posterior chamber. The fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The intraocular tension of right eye was also normal.

Breast examination and gynecological examination were also normal. Clinically, at that stage, differential diagnoses of metastatic carcinoma, astrocytoma, and adult-onset retinoblastoma were considered by treating ophthalmologist and investigations were planned.\nBlood examination was within normal limits. This included hemoglobin values, total leucocyte count, differential leucocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Peripheral blood smear was normal. The kidney function tests, liver functions tests, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum calcium, and serum phosphorus were normal. Urine examination was also normal. Electrocardiogram was also normal.\nNoncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan off the orbit and Para Nasal Sinuses (PNS) revealed marked left proptosis with markedly expanded left ocular globe by a hyperdense mass, few cystic components with extension into left anterior cranial fossa, left anterior ethmoid, left frontal sinus, left frontal fossa soft tissues with destruction of left orbital walls, and great wing of sphenoid bone []. A precise diagnosis was not possible based upon CT findings. The radiologist considered provisional diagnosis of primary intraocular tumor, metastatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma, or lymphoma and advised further investigations. Chest CT and abdomen ultrasonography were carried out and found to be normal. The patient was referred to us for fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) at this stage.\nFNAC was done using a 22-gauze needle. Smears were prepared, air dried, and stained with Giemsa stain and Periodic Acid Schiff's stain (PAS stain). The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears showed small, round cells in cluster and rosettes formation, suggestive of retinoblastoma []. PAS positive granules in the cytoplasm of tumor cells were seen in PAS-stained smears, consistent with the diagnosis of retinoblastoma [].","Doctor: Good Morning, How can I help you today?

Doctor: Okay, I see. Do you have any history of ocular disease or ophthalmic surgery?
Patient: No, I don't have any history of significant ocular disease or ophthalmic surgery.
Doctor: Alright. Let's go ahead with the examination then. Can you describe what you see when you look at your left eye?
Patient: There is a mass protruding from my left eye and it's very painful.
Doctor: Okay, I see. On examination, I see an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye. There is axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball.

The swelling is more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appears stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: On palpation, the mass is tender and soft in consistency. Unfortunately, fundus examination is not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could not be commented upon, but it appeared slightly dilated.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that your left eye is in a very bad condition and it's difficult to examine it thoroughly.
Patient: And what about my right eye?
Doctor: The ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in the posterior chamber. The fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The intraocular tension of the right eye was also normal.
Patient: Hmm.
Doctor: I am sorry to say that your left eye is in a very critical condition and we need to take some tests to determine the exact cause of the problem.

Due to the extent of the disease and associated abscess the anterior wall of the duodenum came away with the colon during this manoeuvre. A retrograde cholecystectomy was carried out to resect the residual tumour invading the gall bladder. The ampulla was identified with the aid of a transcystic catheter. An 82 mm expandable covered duodenal stent with a diameter of 18 mm (Hanarostent, duodenal/pyloric, M.I. Tech Co. Ltd, Seoul, N. Korea) was manually inserted through the duodenal perforation into the proximal duodenum with the distal end of the stent inserted into D2. A small opening into the side wall of the stent was made prior to the positioning of the stent to accommodate the ampulla and thus facilitate drainage of bile within the stent. A per-operative cholangiogram confirmed free flow of contrast in the duodenum. The residual duodenal wall was closed over the stent and following antrectomy a gastrojejunostomy was formed to bypass the duodenum (Bilroth II reconstruction).\nThe patient was discharged 7 weeks later following a prolonged, but otherwise uncomplicated recovery. He subsequently underwent a palliative course of chemotherapy survived for a further 18 months without gastrointestinal symptoms, before succumbing to his disease.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I was admitted to the hospital 10 months ago with a history of epigastric pain, fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Sure, I had a lot of pain in my upper stomach and I was very tired all the time. I also lost 10 kgs and my skin turned yellow.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. And what happened during the Clinical examination?
Patient: The examination showed that I was anemic and there was a tender mass in my right upper quadrant.
Doctor: I see. And did you have any CT scan done?
Patient: Yes, I did. The scan revealed a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass near my duodenum. It contained fluid and air and was close to my colon.
Doctor: Okay, and what was the working diagnosis?
Patient: The doctors said it was a collection caused by a perforation in my colon. I was treated with antibiotics and improved with conservative management.
Doctor: I see. And after that, what happened next?
Patient: I was discharged after a month and had a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy showed a lesion in my transverse colon and the histology showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Doctor: Okay. And then, did you come back to the hospital again?
Patient: Yes, I did. I had an upper gastrointestinal bleed and came back to the Accident and Emergency Department.
Doctor: I see. And what did the repeat CT scan show?
Patient: The scan showed localised perforation in my colon with an abscess near my duodenum, and thickening in my ascending colon around my hepatic flexure.
Doctor: Hmm. Given the presentation and diagnostic uncertainty, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, right?
Patient: Yes, that's right. The laparoscopy showed a large perforated tumour at my hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules.
Doctor: I see. And then, what happened next?
Patient: A laparotomy was performed through a transverse incision and the tumour was found to have invaded my gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity in front of the second part of my duodenum.
Doctor: I see. And was it possible to resect the tumour and form a primary closure of the duodenum?
Patient: No, it wasn't possible. The size of the hole was 5 cm × 2 cm and there was a lot of malignant tumour invading the duodenum.
Doctor: I see. And what was done then?
Patient: A right hemicolectomy was performed to remove as much of the tumour as possible and an ileotransverse anastamosis was formed.
Doctor: I see. And what was the reason for that?
Patient: Due to the extent of the disease and the associated abscess, the anterior wall couldn't be repaired.
Doctor: I see. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?
Patient: No, I think that's all, doctor. Thank you for your time.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to come back and see me.","{

During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned and referred for pathologic examination, in an attempt to determine the etiology of the rapid sequential development of the giant fusiform aneurysm.\nFollow-up angiography, performed three days after the bypass surgery, revealed a patent bypass graft. After a test balloon occlusion at the level of the proximal basilar artery, which ensured adequate perfusion to the upper parts of the brain stem and cerebellum through the left PCoA (), coil embolization of the basilar trunk aneurysm was done. Fourteen detachable platinum coils with a total length of 155 cm were deployed in the aneurysm. Upon completion of the embolization procedure, the blood flow to the posterior circulation through the PCoA was maintained well, with near-complete occlusion of the aneurysm (). Postprocedural heparinization was not done. The patient was managed in the neurosurgical intensive care unit and recovered without further neurologic deficit. However, six hours after the end of the embolization procedure, the patient developed dyspnea, dysarthria, and quadriparesis. Intubation and ventilator care was undertaken, and heparinization was started. Enlargement of the aneurysm due to thrombus was revealed by MR imaging, and angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm. The patient became stable after two days and, one month after the intervention, independent daily activity became possible and she was discharged from hospital. Pathologic examination of the vessel specimen showed intraluminal projections of fibrous tissue with smooth muscle and capillary proliferation, but failed to reach a definite etiologic diagnosis.\nFollow-up angiography performed three months and one year post-treatment, respectively, revealed complete and stable occlusion of the basilar trunk aneurysm and good perfusion to the entire brain. MR imaging showed marked shrinkage of the aneurysm of the basilar trunk, with no evidence of brain stem compression (). In contrast, the size of the carotid fusiform aneurysm showed no significant change. The patient is currently leading a normal life as a housewife.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you in today?
Patient: Good morning doctor, I was admitted to your institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me more about your condition?
Patient: Yes, a giant ICA aneurysm was found during a previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy on my right side in November 2001. 
Doctor: I understand. And what happened after that?
Patient: At that time, a tortuous basilar artery was found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation. I underwent endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital.
Doctor: Okay, got it. And then?
Patient: However, I developed severe headache seven months after the treatment.
Doctor: I see. And what happened when you were admitted to our institution?
Patient: At the time of admission, I complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area.
Doctor: Okay, and did you undergo any tests?
Patient: Yes, Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities.
Doctor: I see. And what about the MR imaging?
Patient: On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem.
Doctor: Okay, and what did the cerebral angiography show?
Patient: The cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk.
Doctor: I see. And what was the situation with the left anterior inferior cerebellar artery?
Patient: The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.
Doctor: I understand. And what was the treatment plan?
Patient: To relieve the brain stem compression, the doctor decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention.
Doctor: I see. And what was done before performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm?
Patient: In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft.
Doctor: I understand. And why was the bypass performed?
Patient: This was because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since I had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA.
Doctor: I see. And what did the bypass supply?
Patient: The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory.
Doctor: I see. And what happened to the blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation?
Patient: An adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA).
Doctor: I understand. And what happened during surgery?
Patient: During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned.
Doctor: I see. Thank you for explaining to me. I will take a look at your file and get back to you with the follow-up plan.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.","{

MR angiogram performed at the same time also did not show any evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or nidus []. The patient was again observed and asked to follow-up. The patient presented after 4 years, at the age of 9 years, with complaints of intermittent episodes of seizures. A MRI was again repeated which showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan. On T2 weighted image, some abnormal vessels were seen in the region of the gliotic cavity. MR angiography showed the presence of an arteriovenous malformation fed by the branches of the middle cerebral artery []. A four vessel angiogram was performed which showed an arteriovenous malformation fed by multiple anterior branches of the middle cerebral artery and drained via multiple veins in the superior sagittal sinus. The patient was advised surgery at this time, but since she only had intermittent episodes of seizures the parents were not willing for surgery. One year after this the patient again presented with complaints of intractable seizures. Digital substraction angiography showed the arteriovenous malformation, similar in size and configuration as was seen earlier []. The patient was now operated. The arteriovenous malformation was resected with routine surgical steps and considerations. The arteriovenous malformation was of significantly high-flow, but could be safely dissected and resected. Post-operatively the patient did well and she did not have any added neurological deficit. Post-operative angiogram showed excision of the arteriovenous malformation. At a follow-up after 1 year of surgery, she was well and was free from convulsions. Her hemiparesis persisted.","Doctor: Hi, how are you doing today?
Patient: I'm okay, thank you.
Doctor: Can you tell me what brings you here today?
Patient: I have been having seizures and I was told to come see you.
Doctor: Okay, I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your history with seizures?
Patient: Well, I first presented to you when I was 5 years old with an episode of convulsion, loss of consciousness, and hemiplegia on my left side.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what did we do for you back then?
Patient: You did a CT scan and angiography, and I was managed conservatively.
Doctor: That's right. And did you have any follow-up visits after that?
Patient: Yes, I came back a year later and my power in my left limbs had improved to Grade 3-4 out of 5, and I was able to walk on my own with some support.
Doctor: That's great to hear. And did we do any imaging studies during that visit?
Patient: Yes, you did a MRI and it showed resolution of the hematoma and the presence of a gliotic cavity.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And did you have any more episodes of seizures after that?
Patient: Yes, I had intermittent episodes of seizures when I was 9 years old.
Doctor: And what did we do for you then?
Patient: You did another MRI and it showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan, and some abnormal vessels on T2 weighted image. And then you did an MR angiogram which showed an arteriovenous malformation.
Doctor: I see. And what did we advise you to do at that time?
Patient: You advised me to have surgery, but my parents were not willing since I only had intermittent seizures.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. And did you have any more follow-up visits after that?
Patient: Yes, I came back a year later with intractable seizures. And you did a digital substraction angiography which showed the arteriovenous malformation.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And what did we do for you then?
Patient: You operated on me and resected the arteriovenous malformation.
Doctor: Okay, I see. Thank you for sharing your history with me. Is there anything else you would like to tell me about your condition?
Patient: No, that's all.
Doctor: Alright. I will need to examine you and do some tests to see if there's anything else we need to do. Can you come back for a follow-up visit in a month?
Patient: Sure, I will come back.
Doctor: Great. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.","{
